{"prompt":"Clickbait: A man swallowed a microSD card and you won't believe what happened next!\n\nArticle: PetaPixel is one of my favorite blogs. The writers there are passionate and knowledgable about their subject, and love diving into both the art of photography, and the technical gear available for photography.\nAlso, they just ran a story about a man who swallowed a 64GB microSD card and then pooped it into a strainer so he could maybe recover the drone footage he shot on it.\nThe story is written in the first person by \"John Doe,\" who is apparently embarrassed by the incident and chose to remain anonymous. And it’s not really important why or how he swallowed the card, containing the whole day’s worth of drone footage he’d just captured. What’s important is that he couldn't puke it back up, and therefore had to poop it into a pasta strainer and then plug it in to a computer to see if the client’s footage was intact.\nLook, I don’t want to ruin this whole story for you. Does John Doe get fired? Do his colleagues make fun of him forever? Do some data recovery experts eventually discover that while the microSD’s controller was broken, the memory was still intact, and everything’s going to be okay John, don’t cry, please don’t cry?\nYeah. But man. He pooped a microSD card! I can’t believe it!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" a man who swallowed a 64GB microSD card and then pooped it into a strainer END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: The question former O.J. Simpson prosecutor hates being asked\n\nArticle: As the lead prosecutor in the O.J.

Clark tells \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\" what it felt like to return to normal life after the notorious murder trial.\n\"In the beginning, I really missed it,\" Clark says about being a prosecutor. \"It's more than just a job, it's something that you live, eat and breathe -- to stand up for the victims, to stand up for justice.\"\nThe turning point, Clark says, came when she took up writing. Since leaving the courtroom, Clark has published three novels based on a fictional Los Angeles prosecutor named Rachel Knight. \"Writing novels and being in the courtroom – it's a storytelling job, no matter how you look at it,\" she says. \"It's the same thing.\"\nWhile she hopes to one day be known as \"Marcia Clark, the author of the Rachel Knight mystery series\" and not \"Marcia Clark, the O.J.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: What are mosquito-control workers spraying in Miami?\n\nArticle: (CNN) After the first locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus were identified in a small area north of downtown Miami, officials began to spray an insecticide over a 10-square-mile portion of Miami-Dade County. But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?\nThe main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.\nNaled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHowever, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.\nIn Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.\nBy contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.\nThe Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.\n\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.\nSince the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.\nAerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.\n\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.\nHis research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.\nIf the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.\nNaled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.\nMiami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.\nZika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.\nZika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.\nAlthough spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said. Yet some environmentalists are not OK with any effects to land and sea, he said.\n\"It's a balancing act,\" Phillips said.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Dibrom END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Rebekah Brooks is back with Rupert Murdoch, and this time it's digital\n\nArticle: \"This one.\"\nThose were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal.\nHe was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw.\nWhile Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.\nThat speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media.\nUpward mobility\nBrooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32.\nKnown as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana.\nAnother time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper — The Sunday Times — and then stole one of the paper's scoops.\nBrooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World.\nHaving risen to the top of Britain's media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron's communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal.\nA fall from the top, but not from grace\nBrooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her.\nBy January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.\nThe inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.\nBrooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media.\nPeter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges.\n\"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said.\nBut it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him.\nAn odd fit\nEven if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world.\nStoryful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners.\nThe startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.)\nNews Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company.\nStoryful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility.\nNow, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.\nI feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http:\/\/t.co\/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015\nWait, what?

Reports from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal say that her position will include work on digital and social media initiatives broadly, with Storyful being one part of that puzzle.\nNews Corp declined to respond to inquires about Brooks and Storyful.\nBrooks comes off to some as an odd fit for the role. As an editor for tabloid newspapers, she has had little experience with digital media or technology.\nJukes noted similarities between Brooks's new position and News Corp's acquisition of MySpace for $580 million. The company later sold the social network for $35 million.\n\"James Murdoch acquired MySpace and it didn't improve. One has to fear for Storyful in that Rebekah Brooks, for all her many talents as a tabloid journalist and editor, has really shown no mastery of social media,\" Jukes said.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The oven cleaning hacks that will have your appliance sparkling without ANY scrubbing\n\nArticle: Scrubbing the oven is one of the most dreaded spring cleaning jobs.\nBut now a new series of kitchen hacks reveals how you can get your appliance sparkling in no time at all - by using just a few simple products you probably already have in your home.\nFrom removing oil by adding more oil to banishing bad smells with lemon and water, these are the very easy - and cheap - tricks that will clean what is often the filthiest part of a kitchen.\n1. CREATE YOUR OWN CLEANER\n'A nifty cleaning cheat for treating stubborn stains is to use a homemade oven cleaner,' advises Rik Hellewell, founder and MD at oven valeting service Ovenu, who put together the tips.\n'This helps save you time and money. A simple mixture of white vinegar and baking soda works wonders to help remove grease and grime.\n'The vinegar will react with the baking soda to foam gently.\n'Rub the paste onto the area you need to treat and leave it for 30 minutes to get to work. Then once the time’s up, you should be able to wipe the dirt away easily.'\n2. CLEAN SHELVES IN 30 MINUTES\n'When was the last time you removed the shelves from your oven?' asks Rik.\n'Probably not that recently. However, in order to cook your food in a hygienic environment, you need to ensure that you keep them sparkling clean.\n'A quick way to restore your shelves to their former glory is to place the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak. Make sure you read the instructions on the cleaning product and wear protective clothing where necessary.\n'After 30 minutes, remove the shelving from the resealable bag. Rinse them under warm water and use a scourer to scrub away any remaining burnt-on food.'\n3. USE AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH\n'An old toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool. Its soft bristles and flexible head allow you to clean areas that would otherwise be out of reach.\n'Even better, if you use an electric toothbrush, the vibration will help to loosen any burnt-on food.\n4. USE A GLASS SCRAPER\n'A glass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains from the door and floor of your oven.\n'If the door is removable, unscrew it and soak in oven cleaner and warm water, then scrape the stuck-on food residue away.'\n5. REMOVE OIL WITH OIL\n'It may sound strange, but you can remove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil.\n'In fact, this technique will make clean-ups in the future really easy. Place a couple of drops of vegetable oil onto a paper towel and rub it over the greasy area.\n'The oil helps to remove the grease without the use of any harsh chemicals. Once clean, spray the areas with all-purpose oven cleaner to ensure that no oil remains.'\n6. BANISH BAD SMELLS EASILY\n'We’ve all cooked a wonderful meal only to have the smell linger for days.\n'If you’ve cooked something especially pungent, like fish, a few drops of vanilla or citrus essence can work wonders.\n'Simply add a few drops in an ovenproof bowl filled with water. Slowly heat the bowl for an hour and you’ll soon rid your kitchen of those pongs.\n7. USE CAR WAX FOR GREASE\n'A dirty hob is a sure sign of a dirty oven. A thin layer of car wax on your hob can help remove built-up grease. Simply apply and wipe away.\n'If any dirt remains, don’t worry. To get a ceramic hob clean, sprinkle with baking soda and a few drops of water. Then wipe clean with a soft cloth. If your oven has steel burners then place them in a resealable bag overnight with a drop of bleach and warm water. The next day, wipe the burners down and wash in warm, soapy water.'\n8. POLISH WITH CREAM OF TARTAR\n'Cream of tartar may seem like an odd cleaning product to use on your oven, but it is extremely effective at keeping stainless steel shiny.\n'Simply apply with a thin cloth, leave for 10 minutes, then wipe away.'\n9. REMOVE STUCK ON FOOD WITH DISHWASHER TABLETS\n'Dishwasher tablets are excellent at removing stuck-on food from your pots and pans in a dishwasher, so why should your oven be any different?\n'Take a dishwasher tablet and dip half of it in warm water. Next rub the tablet over the built-up grease on your oven door and watch the burnt-on dirt wash away with minimal effort.'\n10. HOW TO NEVER SCRUB AGAIN\n'There’s a very quick and easy way to battle grease and grime.\n'Make sure that your oven is completely cool and then spray oven cleaner into the corners. Leave overnight if you can; if not, leave for at least four hours.\n'After the product has worked its magic, you should be able to simply wipe the grime away. If any burnt-on food remains, cover with your homemade cleaning solution of white vinegar and baking soda.' \n\n###\n\n","completion":" homemade oven cleaner\nplace the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak\nold toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool\nglass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains\nremove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil END"}

Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.\nA meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.\nMore precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.\nEven more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.\n\"One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,\" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. \"So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.\"\nBut it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\"\nThe analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.\nPractice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests \"deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,\" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.\nSo what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?\nHere's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.\nBut Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.\n\"There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,\" she says.\nInstead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:\nPersonality and perseverance\nPropensity to get injured\nPropensity to choke under pressure\nIndividual differences in maximum oxygen uptake\nDifferences in how we acquire muscle mass\nCoordination\nHeight\nEnjoyment of competition\n\"We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,\" she says. \"All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.\"\nOverall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular \"10,000 hour rule,\" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.\nOn the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.\n\"Eighteen percent is big,\" Macnamara says. \"We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything.\" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.\nFor the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a \"slow learner\" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.\nGrowing up, my dad was on a quest to find \"my sport\" — the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.\nI'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.\nThese days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Some people are just better at sports than others END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: 1\/3 of Americans believe this about the Syria conflict\n\nArticle: Most things aren't really the end of the world, but one-third of Americans who were surveyed believe that the Syria conflict is an indication that our days are numbered. A biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of Damascus and links it to the coming of Armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen.\nA LifeWay Research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, \"I believe the battles in Syria are all part of the prophecies of the Book of Revelation,\" and 32 percent of them said yes.\nTwenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that \"U.S. military intervention in Syria might lead to the Battle of Armageddon that’s spoken about in the Book of Revelation.\"\nGender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between Biblical prophecy and the current situation in Syria.\nLocation and income also skewed the results, with Southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect Syria with the end of days.\nIn addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, \"I believe the world will end in my lifetime.\"\nThe Rev. Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times \"want to know that God is in charge. They want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel,\" according to LifeWay. Though he believes the Bible does predict future events in the Middle East, the author of The End: A Complete Overview of Bible Prophecy and the End of Days said that he \"does not think the trouble in Syria was predicted in the Bible.\"\nIsaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating Syria to the end of the world. It states:\nThe burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. (King James version)\nEd Stetzer, president of LifeWay Research, was surprised by the results of the survey. He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia \"didn't get the same reaction.\" However, Syria's shared border with Israel, as well as the explicit Biblical mention of Damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses.\nStetzer said that he could see why attaching Biblical significance to the Syria conflict would appeal to many Christians, because, \"For Christians, the end of the world doesn’t mean despair. The end is really a new beginning.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" apocalyptic omen END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: She might be the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette war thanks to Stephen Colbert\n\nArticle: \"I felt kind of icky to be benefiting from this fight,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"At the same time, the opportunity to reach readers is a fantasy.\"\n\"I did still wonder whether anyone would care,\" she added.\nOh, they care. \"California,\" which arrives on Tuesday, is now one of the most preordered debut titles in Hachette history, according to a company spokeswoman. Ms. Lepucki’s agent is negotiating rights with the producer Gregg Fienberg and Killer Films. Little, Brown and Company, the Hachette division behind \"California,\" has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour.\nMs. Lepucki found herself in Portland, Ore., this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore Powell’s Books, where \"California\" hit No. 1 on the best-seller list after Mr. Colbert directed viewers there.\n\"Occasionally, my brain would overheat, and I’d forget how to write,\" she said of her signing session. \"My signature is like a squished spider.\"\nHow Ms. Lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck. And it has a twist: Her husband, Patrick Brown, is employed, in a sense, by Amazon. He works for Goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; Amazon acquired it last year.\n\"Amazon has historically been a bully, and I don’t shop there,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"But I love Goodreads. For the record. And my marriage.\"\nMr. Colbert’s promotion of \"California\" started with Sherman Alexie, an anti-Amazonian and National Book Award winner for \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\" Mr. Colbert invited Mr. Alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by Amazon’s refusal to take Hachette preorders. Mr. Alexie said that he asked Hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse.\n\"California\" was on the top of the stack. \"I honestly suspected it wasn’t going to be my kind of book — too earnest,\" Mr. Alexie said in a telephone interview. \"But I started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner.\"\nWith its post-apocalyptic setting, \"California\" mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction. But Ms. Lepucki sees it as a love story. A young couple, Frida and Cal, have fled the ruins of Los Angeles to make a home in the wilderness. Everything changes when Frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats.\nIt seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, where she grew up, the freckled Ms. Lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke. Still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously.\n\"I have a darker imagination than most people,\" she said. \"If you don’t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, I don’t think you’re really human.\"\nMs. Lepucki winced when asked if the couple in \"California\" is modeled on her and her husband. It’s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, Dixon Bean, while writing.\nBut no. \"I’m madly in love with my husband, but it’s not us,\" she said. \"People seem to hate Frida, so I hope I’m not her.\" (Her mother-in-law’s response to the book: \"I’m sad she killed me in a blizzard.\")\nMs. Lepucki is a graduate of Oberlin College and the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and is the founder and director of Writing Workshops Los Angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008. She is also known in book circles as a writer for The Millions, a highbrow literary website.\n\"California\" is actually her second novel. But the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, Erin Hosier, called \"the novel equivalent of a Harmony Korine movie,\" failed to sell to a publisher. \"It was overly ambitious,\" Ms. Hosier said. \"We finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful.\"\nThat put more pressure on \"California.\" \"You really can’t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials,\" Ms. Hosier said.\nEven before the boost from Mr. Colbert, \"California\" was receiving praise from respected novelists like Jennifer Egan and Ben Fountain and popping up on summer reading lists. Little, Brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers.\nBut insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed. She had another confession to make, too: Yes, she shuns Amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of Bag Balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders. \"I had a chapped elbow,\" she explained.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Edan Lepucki END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Lawmakers are going to punish university for not shutting down \"Sex Week\"\n\nArticle: A group of conservative Tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the state's flagship public university over a student-organized event in early March called \"Sex Week\" -- by dramatically cutting back its ability to host guest speakers.\nState lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the University of Tennessee (UT) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to \"engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events.\" Even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.)\nAnother bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker.\nBoth of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics.\nCampfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013.\nLast week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week.\nGov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law.\nUniversity leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block Sex Week because the First Amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. Bell and Gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. But UT system President Joe DiPietro told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that the university did not have \"any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program.\"\nAttendance at Sex Week increased this year, according to the school's Daily Beacon. Sex Week organizers told HuffPost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an UT administrator said in February that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni.\nNonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\"\nOn Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday.\nA UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said:\nWhile I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized.\nUT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard.\n\"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" University of Tennessee END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The surprising thing that may be making you crave junk food\n\nArticle: The 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out. So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste...\nBy Jena Pincott\n\"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\"\nTry this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1\/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers.\n\"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\"\nOK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them.\n\"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\"\nA bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.\n\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"\nSurprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.\n\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"\nWhile the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)\n\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"\nGood news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.\n\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"\nNow consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO. (But burger lovers, be heartened: Scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" gut bacteria END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: If Donald Trump were black, would the GOP base accept him? The answer is obvious.\n\nArticle: Last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host — let’s call him Donell Trump — announced his candidacy for president of the United States. A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, \"fat,\" \"ugly\" and \"pigs\"; he told one female journalist she had \"the face of a dog.\"\nOnce the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, Donell Trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. He joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. If Donell Trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told Esquire in 1991: \"It really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"\nThen there’s money. Donell Trump can’t get enough of it. He’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star. A substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but Donell Trump has no apologies.\nDonell Trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. He routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on Manhattan’s 5th Avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent.\nPresented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? Would Bill O’Reilly and Jerry Falwell Jr. praise Donell Trump as a model American businessman and moral leader? Or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and \"baby daddy\" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of African American absentee fatherhood? Would Rush Limbaugh insist that Donell Trump’s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? Or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of Ebonics?\n\" A racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. f t\nIn a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated President Obama. An intellectual, Ivy League-educated, cool-tempered family man, Obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-Christ, a crypto-Muslim Manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy America. Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme.\nGranted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong. The values Donell Trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president.\nMy point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a \"thug.\"\nSome conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public.\nMoreover, so much of Donald Trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump’s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.\nWhich brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society. Yet it’s far from hidden; it courses through the presidential campaign, as the notion of a Donell Trump candidacy clearly shows.\nJames Kirchick is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Initiative.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: This might be the darkest theory yet about why Donald Trump keeps winning\n\nArticle: On television and on the stump, at debates and in speeches, Donald Trump is reminding the American people that they are going to die.\nThe reminders aren’t explicit, and they probably aren’t part of an intentional strategy. All the same, much of Trump’s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers’ omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to Sheldon Solomon, a psychologist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\nThat includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. Study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for Trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally.\n\"I’m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring,\" Solomon said.\nSolomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology.

Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book \" The Denial of Death ,\" but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor.\n\"It was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof,\" Solomon said. He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation.\nTheir research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven’t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death.\nFor example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death.\nSolomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.\nThen the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. Shown \"C O F F _ _,\" for example, many people might write \"COFFEE,\" especially students in college. If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead.\nThe participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.\nAssigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.\nSolomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.\nYet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Ex-Cons Remember Their Worst Jobs After Being Released from Prison\n\nArticle: Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through \"work-release.\" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.\nThat said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between.\nAfter serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison.\nImage of cattle ranchers via Wikimedia Creative Commons\nMendoor Smith, 43-Year-Old from Iowa\nServed 12 Years for Marijuana Possession\nReleased from Custody in 2013\nThe worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens.\nI remember calving one shift during the winter, and when I did my hourly inspection of the herd, I noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. Having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating.\nI had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise.\nDavid Hibdon, 55-Year-Old from Missouri\nServed 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy\nReleased from Custody in 2014\nMy first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car.\nI worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after.\nI've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. I eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. I could go back to the dump if I wanted, but that job sucked.\nImage of a telemarketing call center via\nMike Vargas, 44-Year-Old from Washington DC\nServed 14 Years for a Drug Conspiracy\nReleased from Custody in 2009\nIt wasn't hard getting a job when I came home, it just wasn't a good job. I started working the same week I was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. You had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. It was cool at first, but after a while I was starting to feel like a robot.\nI worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. Anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. You had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. If you went to get a Coke, you had to clock out. If you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. If you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. There was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course.\nDudes would curse out the boss. One dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. He walked out shortly after. But most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. I quit that job when I had something better lined up. It served its purpose because if you don't have a gig you have to stay at the halfway. I've had like seven or eight jobs since then. I've done a lot of different things, but that was the worst. I'm a machinist now, and I assemble parts all day at a machine. It's easier and the pay is better, but I am always looking for something better.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer,\npicking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather\ntelemarketing place END"}

In a video that seems to show some kind of Star Wars celebration, an apparent poster depicts Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.\nEpisode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.\nIf this is truly the title, we will definitely be in for an interesting storyline. However, I don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set.\nIndeed, Star Wars has a long history of doing this. Check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years.\nStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace\nAhh, Episode I, how hyped you were. But that is beside the point. While the title The Phantom Menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. The original was Episode I: The Beginning. Pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. Personally, I liked this title much more than The Phantom Menace and I think they should have stuck with it.\nStar Wars: Episode II – Attack Of The Clones\nThis is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. Episode II – Attack of the Clones brought us the lovable Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in Jar Jar Binks. And this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for Episode II was Episode II: Jar Jar's Big\/Great Adventure. Could you imagine if Lucasfilm actually ran with this? The backlash would have been insurmountable and I don't think it would have every recovered from that. #HailJarJar!\nStar Wars: Episode VI – Return Of The Jedi\nHighly regarded as one of the best films of all time, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi is a pop culture classic. It was so popular that Family Guy titled the first part of its Star Wars trilogy after Episode VI's working title. Of course, I am referring to the infamous Blue Harvest, which was the name that was used during production of Return of the Jedi — and a name that will always be etched in the minds of Star Wars fanatics everywhere.\nStar Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens\nThe Force Awakens was easily one of the most anticipated films of ALL TIME. Unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. It was titled after J.J. Abrams' production company and was referred to as Episode VII: Foodles. A bit adolescent I know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless.\nStar Wars: Episode VII – Fall Of The Resistance (Possibly)\nThe apparent leaked title of the next installment is Fall of the Resistance. Whether this is the actual title or a working title is a mystery in itself, but Episode VIII already has a working title, according to Carrie Fisher — Space Bear: Episode VIII. No, this is not a joke. Fisher tweeted out a photo of her adorable dog sitting on a chair with this supposed headline.\nPretty adorable, and the whole crew seems to really be having a great time working on Episode VIII. #SpaceBear2017!\nSo What Is Your Favorite Star Wars Working Title?\nWith each Star Wars temporary name, there are some funny ones and definitely some weird ones.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: 5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen\n\nArticle: oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. Problem is, he won’t carry his EpiPen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket.\n\"It’s large and it’s impractical,\" Clark said. \"Where’s he going to put it?\"\nThis underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great.\nThey’re reliable, sure. They’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital.\nBut they’re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they’re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs.\nThe devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is \"investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.\"\nBut critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: \"If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,\" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law.\n\"EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug,\" Price said.\nCompetitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product. But it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap.\nHere’s why:\n1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025\nEpinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s.\nBut Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust.\nThe company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack.\nThe very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.)\n\"If you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment,\" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. \"You just have to know how to use it.\"\nAllen’s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on Mylan’s patent.\n\"It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,\" Allen said. \"It’s not rocket science. It’s purely the patent that stops us.\"\n2. There’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis\nChris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years.\nWindgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated.\nBut that’s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market.\nThough EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said.\n\"It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\"\nOne EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it’s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved.\n3. It doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps\nIn the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine.\n\"We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,\" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said.\nMannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations.\nThe same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis.\n4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive\nA lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product.\n\"The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,\" Baum said. \"But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.\"\nPublic anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it.\n\"We’re just focused on being that competition,\" he said.\n5. The public hasn’t spoken (loud enough)\nDenise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy.\nBut though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines.\n\"It’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I’ve looked at it closely — until I had to start paying all this money,\" Clark said.\nGranted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation.\n\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025\n2.

In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains\nThe LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift.\nWe are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn’t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community.\nWe should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn’t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media!\n15 Kristen Stewart\nActress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said \"Make America Gay Again.\" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump.\n14 Aubrey Plaza\nWho didn’t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy’s (Chris Pratt’s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress’ unique and distinguishable character traits aren’t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender \"isn’t a factor\" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don’t identify as either. Plaza’s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very \"androgynous and masculine\" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love \"with girls and guys,\" and that she can’t help it.\n13 Mara Wilson\nSometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote \"F*cking hell, Orlando.\" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: \"I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself.\" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one’s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual.\n12 Colton Haynes\nActor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes’ \"secret gay past,\" and that it got them \"so excited.\" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing \"Was it a secret? Let’s all just enjoy life & have no regrets.\" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes’ way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn’t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy!\n11 Reid Ewing\nIf the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that’s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: \"Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af.\" Someone commented and asked \"Did you just out yourself?\" to which Ewing replied \"I was never in.\" *Drops mic* That’s the way to do it!\n10 Shane Dawson\nFor years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people’s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled \"I’m Bisexual.\" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn’t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they’re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, \"I don’t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,\" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual.\n9 Ryan Beatty\nAnother celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that’s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words \"raging homosexual\" and \"gay power.\" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is \"comfortable enough to say it\" and \"can finally breathe.\" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: \"i’m so happy i’m gay\" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, \"Passion.\"\n8 Rayvon Owen\nSome of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol’s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song \"Can’t Fight It\" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In \"Can’t Fight It,\" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something’s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man’s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 15 Kristen Stewart\n14 Aubrey Plaza\n13 Mara Wilson\n12 Colton Haynes\n11 Reid Ewing END"}

Here’s what they have in common\n\nArticle: Nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. Here’s what they have in common\nEvery night for 20 years, Gino Rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters’ beds and whispered an incantation. As rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the South Side of Chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl’s ear as she slept: \"I can and I will.\" The message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep.\n\"You talk to the subconscious. You don’t talk to the conscious,\" Rodriguez says. \"That’s the one that really listens.\"\nThe girls slept \"hot-dog style,\" cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. They occasionally woke up during their father’s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. But each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, \"Today is going to be a great day. I can and I will.\"\nVideo by Diane Tsai for TIME\nNot all days were great—the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. But the three daughters of Puerto Rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. They learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. They bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quinceañeras.\nAnd one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon graduated from Harvard Business School and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. Rebecca Rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. And Gina Rodriguez won a Best Actress Golden Globe for her starring role on Jane the Virgin.\n\"We lived the idea of the American Dream,\" Gina says. \"And they made an environment where that was possible.\"\nThe Rodriguez Family\nLeft and Right: Courtesy of the Rodriguez Family\nThis is a story about nine American families with children, like the Rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. The Emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and Hollywood. The Wojcicki sisters became scientists, CEOs and tech entrepreneurs. The Simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the Antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. The Srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the Gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. The Dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books.\nEach of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same.\nIn selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead.\nSome of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren’t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn’t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids.\nBut other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did.\nWe talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska. We talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. Here are six striking qualities they shared.\nImmigrant Drive\nAs Gino Rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in Chicago, Saroja Srinivasan, a Hindu who is vegetarian, was mastering the art of the hamburger. She and her husband T.P. Srinivasan settled in Lawrence, Kans., with their three small children in the early 1970s, when T.P. joined the math department at the University of Kansas. Everyone they knew was back in India.\n\"We made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community,\" Saroja recalls. That meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the Kansas Jayhawks in a living room adorned with Indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate \"Krishmas,\" their version of Christmas.\nJust like their neighbors, the three Srinivasan children—Sri, Srija and ­Srinija—played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. But they didn’t have chores in the same way their friends did. In the Srinivasan household, less was required—but more was expected.\nThere was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. \"It was more like, ‘Look around. What’s Mom doing? Does she need help?’\" recalls Srinija, the youngest. \"Put things away. Pay attention.\"\nAlso, nobody got an allowance. Instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. \"On the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance,\" says Srinija. \"On the other hand, responsibility for every choice.\" Her older sister Srija put it this way: \"If I took $20, that meant Sri and Srinija couldn’t go to the movies.\"\nThe Srinivasan Family\nLeft and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family\nThe three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S.\nFor the Srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off. Sri would grow up to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the Supreme Court. Srija is the interim deputy chief for the San Mateo County health system, responsible for public-health efforts affecting more than 700,000 Californians. And Srinija is an entrepreneur who was one of the first employees at Yahoo and now sits on the board of Stanford University.\nIn addition to Puerto Rico and India, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from Israel, Haiti, Poland and China. For their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen.\nThe Gay siblings, a Haitian-American trio, grew up in Nebraska. Roxane Gay is a best-selling author and New York Times opinion writer, Joel Gay is one of the youngest black CEOs ever to helm a publicly traded company (Energy Recovery), and Michael Gay Jr. is a civil engineer. Their upbringing was stricter than their friends’: the kids weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn’t go to a friend’s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. None of that was up for discussion. \"Parenting is not a democracy,\" Nicole says.\nThe Gay Family\nLeft: Courtesy of the Gay Family; Right: Cindy Hegger Photography\nAwareness of the im­migrant experience, compounded by the fact that the Gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. \"Success and performance was not a choice. That was an expectation,\" Michael Gay Sr. says. \"Good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about.\" No one received a gold star from \"General Gay and his attaché, Nicole,\" as Joel calls them.\nBeing from Haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. \"They were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere,\" says Roxane. Adds Joel: \"The more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one’s work ethic is.\" He says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created \"an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself.\"\nParent-Teachers\nOn another university campus, far from the Srinivasans in Kansas, Esther Wojcicki was having a pool party. Her husband Stan was chair of the physics department at Stanford, and they regularly hosted barbecues for students and their families. Their daughters Susan, Janet and Anne would interrogate the guests about theoretical physics when they weren’t busy passing hors d’oeuvres or throwing each other in\n\n###\n\n","completion":" parent who was an immigrant or an educator\nparents were involved in political activism of some kind\nconflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents\nstrong awareness of mortality as children\nthey grew up with much more freedom than their friends END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: This Republican mayor has an incredibly simple idea to help the homeless. And it seems to be working.\n\nArticle: Work program gives homeless dignity, hope\nAlbuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful \"There’s a Better Way\" program, which hires panhandlers to work in maintenance jobs and also aims to connect them with services. Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful \"There’s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor's Office)\nRepublican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\"\nThroughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city’s poorest residents told him they didn’t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn’t know where else to go.\nSeeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them.\nNext month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque’s There’s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.\nIn less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.\n\"You can just see the spiral they’ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it’s remarkable,\" Berry said in an interview. \"They’ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.\"\nPanhandlers are hired to beautify the city. (City of Albuquerque Mayor’s Office)\nBerry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A Berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas.\nThere is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout.\nBut that’s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option. When they’ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years.\nKellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level.\n\"Genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are,\" Tillerson said. \"Many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one. They don’t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don’t assume they are lazy.\"\nThe There’s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs.\nTillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID.\n\"He now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed,\" she said. \"It’s life-changing for them. He was one that said, ‘I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.’ \"\nDozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party.\nHe was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness.\nThe program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point. It’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life.\n\"It’s helping hundreds of people,\" Berry said, \"and our city is more beautiful than ever.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" bring the work to them END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: She Wraps A Piece Of Bread Around Her Foot. When She Takes It Off? SHOCKING!\n\nArticle: Summertime means sandals — at least, when you absolutely have to wear shoes at all! \nIt also means painting your nails cute colors, feeling the grass beneath your soles, and enjoying the cool breeze on your toes.\nBut it also means that you might become more aware of the less cute aspects of your feet...\nAfter years of wear and tear, being stuffed in shoes, and holding up your whole self, everyone’s feet develop rough patches and bumps. This is normal and natural, but it’s not always pleasant.\nWhile calluses typically only look unpleasant and feel rough to the touch, corns — which are hard, rounded types of calluses — can be painful when pressure is applied, such as when walking or wearing a shoe.\nIt can also make you self-conscious if you’re walking around barefoot or in shoes that leave your feet mostly exposed.\nAnd since there’s a lot of evidence that shows going barefoot is really good for your overall health, you’ll definitely want to show off your tootsies this summer.\nBut if you have corns, calluses, or other rough, hard skin on your feet? Never fear. There are simple, inexpensive, and all-natural ways to smooth your feet and get them soft and ready to show off, and you can do them all right at home.\nAnd of course, this isn’t just for feet, so if you have corns or calluses elsewhere, like on your hands, you can try these remedies there, too.\nRead on to learn how to make your feet summer-ready, and then break out some nail polish and wiggle your toes!\nWhat Is A Callus?\nA callus is a thick, tough area of skin that forms in response to repeated and regular friction or pressure. Your body builds up a callus to protect your skin.\nMost people have calluses on their hands and feet caused by walking, holding a pen, or other activity.\nCalluses might be unsightly, but they’re typically harmless and painless.\nWhat Are Corns?\nA corn is actually a type of callus. It’s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes.\nLike a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes.\nUnlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface.\nSo, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do?\nRemedy #1: Apple Cider Vinegar And Castor Oil\nIn a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet.\nThis will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone. For corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak.\nDo this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days.\nA word about filing down calluses: Be gentle. It will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse.\nRemedy #2: Vitamin E Or Vitamin A\nWhile they’re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out.\nRubbing the oil inside a vitamin E or vitamin A capsule is a great treatment for corns.\nRub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock.\nDo this every night until the corn disappears.\nRemedy #3: Lemon Peel\nSlice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it.\nPress it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage. Keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight.\nRepeat every night until the corn is gone.\nRemedy #4: Onion And White Vinegar\nLike the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns.\nBut be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger!\nJust like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight.\nRemedy #5: Bread And Apple Cider Vinegar\nHalf a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot.\nAttach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn’t leak, and then cover with a sock.\nThe callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning.\nRemedy #6: Castor Oil\nThis remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Does Sparkling Water Have a Downside?\n\nArticle: Plain seltzer or sparkling water’s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives.\nSeltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters.\n2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages.\nColas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.\nCarbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It’s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that’s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale).\nBottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.\nAccording to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health.\nAn additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most Americans are already considered too high.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water END"}

John Hickenlooper signed several historic measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, establishing Colorado as the world's first legal, regulated and taxed marijuana market for adults back in May.\nColorado voters passed Amendment 64 last November making the limited sale, possession and growing of marijuana for recreational purposes legal for adults 21 and over. A64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but that home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold, however, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot.\nA64 allows adults to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use even in those cities or counties that have banned retail sales.\nColorado's 271 municipalities and 64 counties must decide by Oct. 1 as to whether they will allow for legal recreational marijuana sales.\nRecreational pot sales in Colorado cities that opt-in can begin on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" La Junta END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: How one man could have fathered 1000 kids\n\nArticle: Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco, \"The Bloodthirsty,\" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000. Now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years.\nIsmaïl, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. He was Sharifian — that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam.\nIsmaïl's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle.\nAny suspicion of adultery against Ismaïl was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years.\nSome researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismaïl had said.\nTo solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record.\n\"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.\nThe simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles.\nThe simulations suggest Ismaïl needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring — the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women.\nAlthough the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismaïl could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction — you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\"\nOberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco\nhave sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: How technology will bring loved ones back to life\n\nArticle: The theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years. By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist.\nCurrently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die.\nThe Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents.\nSince the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today.\n\"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\"\nThough Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet.\n\"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives — preservation first, technology second.\"\nMeanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\"\nEarlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions — its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence.\nWhile the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend.\nInspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you.\n\"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\"\nThe goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\"\nBut intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could.\nOver 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public.\nThe natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy.\nLong-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too.\nShe imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone.\n\"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\"\nWhile the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy — edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory — experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved.\nHeather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one.\nMany already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead.\nAfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave.\nIf people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back?\nBoth Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave.\n\"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says.\nBeyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones.\n\"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way?\nDigital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.\nThese services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves. They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data — the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos — and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were.\nUntil we can really can upload our brains to the cloud, that's our best shot at immortality.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves.

Previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable.\nBefore the lights go on, here are five things to know about Holt:\nHolt is a registered Republican\nDonald Trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode.\n\"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're — they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want — and this, I think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that's what they're doing by gaming the system.\"\nConspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be.\n\"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It’s a very unfair system.\"\nThese are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)\nTime magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.\nHolt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992\nHolt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president.\nHolt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\"\nDominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning.\n\"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\"\nHe's not really into the Twitter\nHolt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these:\nScratching item off list of things I've never done before a newscast. Beach volleyball. Tonight @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com\/CRmpnCcpNU — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 7, 2016\nJoining on stage for some Brazilian Jazz in Rio tonight. #BoyFromIpanema pic.twitter.com\/xJ5MoYGtPZ — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 13, 2016\nIn general, however, it is not unusual for Holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession.\nHe moderated a Democratic primary debate\nHolt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell.\nHe was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the \"reset button\" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state.\n\"Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009,\" Holt said. \"Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\"\nHolt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree\nApparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school.\nHolt left California State University-Sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in San Francisco. The Sacramento Bee told the story last year:\nLester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn’t as worried as his wife, June. \"She predicted poverty and failure,\" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism.\nThings worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Holt is a registered Republican\nHolt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992\nHe's not really into the Twitter\nHe moderated a Democratic primary debate\nHolt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree END"}

Which is the only reason I can assume that I hear this (or some version of this) response so often: \"OMG same! I keep my closet perfectly color-coded!\"\nNow, it's not always color-coding closets -- it could be anything from polishing silverware, to double-checking locks, to eating the same thing every day for breakfast. And yes, OCD symptoms present both in a variety of ways as well as varying degrees. But unless you are educated on the disorder, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- I'm going to be honest and let you know I really, really don't want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis.\nHere's why: It's insensitive to diminish OCD to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\"\nBecause even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and I'll give it to you, maybe even an \"obsession\" or \"compulsion\" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed OCD comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. For my disorder, it's a response that I would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. Thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish.\nNow, I know this isn't your intention, and I try to keep this in mind as I grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing. And don't get me wrong, I'm happy to explain it to you -- but I would much rather do so in response to a question or genuine interest, not a backhanded attempt at empathy.\nMy OCD has affected me for as long as I can remember -- and although it's now managed well enough where it's not necessarily something people notice on their own (a proud accomplishment, if I do say so myself), there have been times it has been debilitating: severe anxiety; bleeding knuckles from obsessive washing; rapid weight drops from stress-related appetite loss; intricate and obscenely repetitive bedtime routines.\nI'm happy to explain this to you, to answer any and all questions -- anyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly a shy or private person. But please, take this route instead of attempting to relate in a way that, unless you actually have diagnosed OCD, you would never be able to. I know you don't mean to come off as both uneducated and insensitive, so please, don't respond as if you are.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"OMG same! I keep my closet perfectly color-coded!\" END"}

For example, taking on too many projects that are unlikely to come to anything.\nInvest wisely: Don’t invest in anything unless you are prepared to put at least 10 per cent of your net worth into it: Some people invest in lots of little things with the belief that it might be a good investment, but when it comes down to it are not that sure.\nIf you are not confident enough to be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into it, then avoid it. So before investing a little into something, don’t ask yourself can you afford to lose this small amount, ask if this is something you would actually be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into.\nAs Warren Buffet says: 'Only invest in companies that can be run by a monkey, because one day it probably will be. You can’t do a good deal with a bad person.'\nSave, save, save: Multi-millionaire Sophia Amoruso, founder of Nasty Gal, says the key to making money is saving it wisely.\nAs she explained in her autobiography #GirlBoss, the more time you spend saving, the more money you’ll make.\nShe said: 'Treat your savings account like just another bill. It has to be paid every month, or there are consequences. If you have direct deposit, have a portion of your paycheck automatically diverted into a savings account.\n'Once it’s in there, forget about it. You never saw it anyway. It’s an emergency fund only (and vacations are not emergencies).'\nKnow the value of your time: Whilst it's important to help our friends, rich people know the value of their time. Indeed, as Kim Garst, founder and CEO of Boom! Social says, explains, you should value what you know and start charging for it.\nSo, if you are skilled in a certain area, charge people for it - and they will actually be willing to pay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Avoid becoming a busy fool: It is very easy to become very busy doing things that are a huge drain on time but have little or no end value\nInvest wisely: Don’t invest in anything unless you are prepared to put at least 10 per cent of your net worth into it\nSave, save, save\nKnow the value of your time END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: Scientists say this behavior can make men more attractive to women\n\nArticle: Scores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isn't just about the way you look.\nFrom being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women — especially if you're looking to land a long-term relationship.\nA growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: Men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don't.\nIn a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships.\nSome of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\"\nBoth men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships — but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did.\nMore recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks.\nIn a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men.\nAbout 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive.\nThe women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive.\nEach pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person.\nAll the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship.\nThe researchers walked away with several key findings.\nFirst, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men.\nSecond, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men.\nPerhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. Unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism.\nIt's hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. But they do suggest that, if you're a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn't hesitate to flaunt the fact that you're an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week.\nIt could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" altruism END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?\n\nArticle: Protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business.\nOver the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.\nAt the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa’s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.\nWhile these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India’s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.\n\"We’re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\"\nGrig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions.\"\nAnnette Hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said.\nAside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.\nOne way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death,\" she said.\nMore broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. \"We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,\" she said.\nFinally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. \"The just war theory,\" she said, \"lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?\" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons.\nNo one has easy answers. \"Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,\" Grig said. She added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. \"I think this is something we need to be discussing,\" she said.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay\n\nArticle: If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour.\nFast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)\nNotice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.\nThe gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.\nOther measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women.\nBailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.\nTake the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).\nRather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far.\nThe Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed.\nThere are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.\nStill, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.\nThe Olympic tax\nSpeaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.\nBut the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.\nThe Fed\nNewly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question.\nThe Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.\nNumber of the week\nBack in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant\n\nArticle: Here’s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student. (Courtesy Ashok Goel)\nTo help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff.\nBut, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.\nAshok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams.\nStudents were amazed. \"I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\" wrote one in the class’s online forum. \"Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\" said another.\nNow Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.\n\"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\"\nAt the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.\nGoel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.\nAs Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.\nTo train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.\nGoel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.\n\"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said.\nThe system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.\nThere are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.\nGoel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education.

Usually such a sitting would require (at least) a rack of clothing and a team of assistants led by the magazine’s fashion and style director, Jessica Diehl.\nIt’s a look. (Vanity Fair)\nWhen I saw the new cover, with Zuckerberg in his signature grey tee and blue jeans, I wondered whether Diehl had styled the cover in a genius homage to the Facebook founder’s personal uniform. In the past, he has attributed his perennial look to a desire to focus his energy on important business decisions, rather than what he characterized as \"silly or frivolous\" choices, such as what to wear. (The personal uniform here becomes the fashion analog of meal-replacement beverage Soylent.)\nI pictured Zuckerberg, safely protected from decision fatigue, while assistants pored over a rack of luxury approximations of his everyday grey tee. Armani or Vince? Lang or Wang?\nAlas, a Vanity Fair spokesperson has confirmed, there was no stylist for this cover, and no designers credited. Zuckerberg wore his own clothes, saving everyone involved in the cover shoot from wasting their brain capacity on fashion.\nDespite Diehl’s recent statement that the magazine’s cover \"is not your casual-jeans Tuesday\" (in reference to Vanity Fair’s issue starring Caitlyn Jenner), Zuckerberg’s Tuesday cover suggests otherwise.\nPerhaps it’s fitting, as this month’s \"New Establishment\" issue is all about power.

And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again.\nElement 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy.\nThe Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices.\nBut if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" £12.99 END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: This company wants to solve all your scanning and filing problems\n\nArticle: Most staple removers fit in the palm of your hand. This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence.\nRipcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn’t made it into the information age – billions of boxes of paper files.\n``We’re drowning in problem,’’ said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.’’\nLike many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access.\nRipcord’s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they’re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer.\nWith billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that’s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord’s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software.\nRipcord isn’t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It’s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord.\nThe machines aren’t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn’t putting people out of work, it’s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached.\n\"We’re not replacing people with machines, we’re giving them much more interesting things to do,\" Fielding said. \"I don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ripcord END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Antibiotics will soon 'stop working'\n\nArticle: Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing \"terrible human and economic cost\", a major study has warned.\nResistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn.\nDrug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.\nResearch has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock.\nAntibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe\n4 show all Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe\n1\/4 K. pneumoniaeis one of the toughest super-infections Alamy\n2\/4 Amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by GPs\n3\/4 Antibiotic resistance cycle\n4\/4 Antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe\nThe report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK.\nLord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA)\nIt calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.\nThe report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.\nAntibiotics crisis is global\nLord O’Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\"\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\"\nDame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\"\nAntibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Is there a better way to observe Veteran's Day?\n\nArticle: All this isn’t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don’t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn’t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.\nDifferences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America’s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America’s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS’s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent END"}

He’s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.\nStart looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?\nI crafted the following chart to find out:\nClick to enlarge!*\nIt looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.\nHowever, even though Bean has perfected his \"I’m dying\" face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.\nBut the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt’s death percentage is similar to Bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of Hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive.\nHe has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven’s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L’Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You’re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.\nMaybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.\nSo is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths\/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths\/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths\/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths\/episode.)\nOf course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt).

{"prompt":"Clickbait: People with this personality type may be happier and more successful\n\nArticle: Are you a \"glass half-full\" or a \"glass half-empty\" kind of person?\nAs it turns out, some people can be both. So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found.\nThese realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]\nOptimists and pessimists\nPast research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said.\nOptimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall.\nAfter several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed.\nSo Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality.\nRealistic views\nThe optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists.\n\"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said.\nInterestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said.\nTraditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments.\nSelf-control key\nShe found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships.\n\"Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said.\nThat allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present.\nBeing a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said.\nThe findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said.\nIn order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" realistic optimists END"}

Eyebrows were raised because Pacquiao had already declared his dedication for public service even prior to his win during the national elections.\nSo what was the truth?\nThe 37-year old boxer unretired for another fight.\nManny Pacquiao announced his retirement, which lasted for 3 months, after his unanimous win against Timothy Bradley.\nPacquiao did not deny his eagerness to come back to his career of 21 years which made him a household name and a worldwide recognized boxer when he rose in eight divisions.\nAfter the game which gave Mahindra a 105-103 win against the defending champion of the Governors’ Cup, the San Miguel Beermen, he confessed to a horde of journalists his aspiration to add another win under his belt. According to him, boxing helped him provide for his family and he does not want to consider his job as a senator as his livelihood.\nWith Las Vegas in mind as the venue, Arum set the date of his fight on November 5. Instead of the usual camp in Hollywood with Freddie Roach, the senator’s camp will be in the Philippines in order for him to still be able to fulfill his duties as a politician.\nPacquiao was elected twice as the congressman of Sarangani before he ran for Senate. His 4 days of attendance in Congress became controversial.\nIt was in May 2015 after his loss against Floyd Mayweather Jr. when news of his retirement floated around. These rumors were put to rest when his third fight with Timothy Bradley was announced. He won the fight against the latter in a unanimous decision.\nWhen asked again about his departure from boxing, Pacquiao left the door open for a potential comeback and true to his prediction, the pride of the Philippines will attempt to bring back glory once again to the country.\nEmmanuel \"Manny\" Dapidran Pacquiao is the first and only eight-division world champion in boxing history.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Here’s the secret way people are using Snapchat Spectacles. \n(Hint: sex)\n\nArticle: When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles—his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses—in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\"\nThere's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy.\nOf course, behind closed doors, it's already happened.\n\"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.)\nSEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles\nRachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York.\n\"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\"\nSnap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages—the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have—made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun.\nTo wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"—which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone—\"was really cool.\"\n\"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's.\nThe idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles—photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless.\nyou have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com\/klm9kZM7B2\n— Damon Beres ✨ (@dlberes) September 24, 2016\nHow will sex tapes change after Spectacles?\n— Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016\nSnapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com\/QosgVH3j9e\n— Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016\nBut you know what they say—there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming.\nGiven the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy.\nYet—most of them have at least had the idea.\n\"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained.\n\"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\"\nOf course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed.\nOf the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex.\n\"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said.\n\"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\"\nThe experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times.\n\"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said.\nIt wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious.\n\"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn’t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said.\nJennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows—literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself.\n\"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"—the color of her Spectacles—\"was a bad choice,\" she said.\n\"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\"\nA series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend.\nWhile Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story.\nThey don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder.\n\"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said.\nRichard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July.\nAs for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still—and isn't unlikely to—show up in the near future.\nJesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there’s a new gadget, we’re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said.\nHis company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013.\n\"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\"\nSnap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however.\nAll sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\"\nThere's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course.\nCindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case.\nShe credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"—which now boasts 150 million daily active users—to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app.\n\"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it.\nIn fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off. I remember thinking at the time: I wish there was a strap,\" Richard said.\nJust as Snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for Spectacles. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" as a sex toy END"}

In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president.\nWell, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\nYou may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime,\" and that they were \"rapists,\" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, \"some are good people.\" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor.\nBehold, the Trump Latinos.\nAccording to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent.\nI can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by Trump’s strong showing with Latinos.\nThe first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.\nTrump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.\nThe other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.\nNow, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about Latinos.\nGranted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That’s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.\nAnd, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren’t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.\nStill, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.\nBut first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states—Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.\nNext, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes. It’s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.\nFinally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.\nLike their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other.\nThat is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they’ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won’t.\"\nNow, here’s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American—is highly aspirational. They don’t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don’t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.\nIn states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.\nAnd what about Trump’s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?\nIt’s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.\nThey’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young DREAM’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.\nLike Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else.\nMeanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.\nThe East Coast media don’t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos.\nFor instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true.\nLatinos don’t want to apart from America, and they aren’t in conflict with America. They are the essence of America.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Trump has a theory.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Pulitzer Prize makes major change\n\nArticle: The Pulitzer Prize has broadened eligibility in feature writing and investigative reporting to include online and print magazines, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced in a press release on Monday.\nIn the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a Pulitzer in any category. But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense.\n\"Pulitzer’s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism,\" Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride said in a statement. \"He envisioned that future generations would make changes in the Plan of Award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.' Increasingly, online and print magazines have expanded their mission. It’s time to enlarge the tent again.\"\nWhile websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the Pulitzer Prize Board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content.\n\"Consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the Board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting,\" the press release read, \"while also recognizing the opportunity provided by the web for integration of text with audio and visual elements to strengthen story-telling and provide information and analysis.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" broadened eligibility in feature writing and investigative reporting to include online and print magazines END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: According To This Study, Drinking Fizzy Drinks Can Have A Disturbing Effect On Your Penis\n\nArticle: Drinking too much of the black stuff could leave you with not enough of the white stuff. Syda Productions\/Shutterstock\nThough there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the Internet – largely led by English tabloids – has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man’s sperm count by as much as thirty percent.\nExactly why this has suddenly become so widely talked about is a bit of a mystery, since as far as we are aware there is no new research to speak of. However, the findings of the study are worth bearing in mind if you happen to be a lover of the self-appointed \"Real Thing\" (and a man).\nAfter examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. Though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes.\nHow these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as the cause, after finding no connection between caffeine in other drinks and sperm count.\nA number of other studies have in the past attempted to find a connection between excessive soda drinking and poor sexual health in men, though most have found no concrete proof of any link. For instance, back in the 1980s, researchers added a variety of Coca-Cola products to sperm in an attempt to see if it reduced their swimming ability, but ultimately did not find enough evidence to support this.\nMore recently, researchers published a report in which they listed several reasons why drinking too much soda could potentially cause erectile dysfunction. For instance, they explain that high sugar intake could cause some of the blood vessels in the penis to become clogged up with fat, impeding blood flow and making it harder to get an erection.\nAs such, they conclude that there is a high probability of a connection between soft drinks and soft penises, though they can’t confirm this without conducting a long-term study.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital\nreduce a man’s sperm count by as much as thirty percent END"}

Instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp. He converted it into a boat's cabin.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: This bot has saved users $250 million, and it's coming to Facebook messenger\n\nArticle: Late last year, just in time for Christmas shopping, Rachel Rhoads got a nice surprise. One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.\nRhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. \n\"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" \nGetting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the San Francisco startup’s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month. Digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.\nDigit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.\nDigit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger’s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they’re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.\nThe company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic.\nAlso on the product horizon is having Digit’s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. \nThere are hitches. Since Digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.\nAnother hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"\nBehavioral finance underlies much of Digit’s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.\n\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie’s Education Fund,' I’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.\nBloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit’s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.\n\"We want to make Digit understand more—not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, ‘Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?’ And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"\nThat kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?\" (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)\n(Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Digit END"}

The statue presents an obvious trigger for many students, who are forced to see it outside their window before they're going to sleep, or as they're on their way to class.\nMatelli responded to the controversy with his own criticism earlier this month, telling WBZ, \"I think that these people are misconstruing this work. I think they’re seeing something in this work that isn’t there. But who am I to say how people should react to this?\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The statue, titled \"Sleepwalker\"\nWellesley College END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: Something Makes This Grandmother Run Out in the Rain...When You See Why, It Will Make You Cry!\n\nArticle: A short film called Light Rain directed by Neil Horner and written by Bob Perks reminds us that sometimes we should not worry about the little things. The 4-minute film, narrated from the perspective of the old woman, shows a bunch of people sheltering from the rain when a confused little girl asks her mother ‘why can’t they run through the rain’. Her mother tells her that if they do, they’d be soaked. But then the little girl says something so profound that it changes the mother’s mind and the two do exactly what the sweet girl wanted to do – They RUN through the RAIN... What the girl says, is a strong reminder of the need to avoid getting weighed down by little problems on a daily basis.\nIt also reminds us that there are people in worse conditions with real troubles in the world, before which our daily trivial hindrances are nothing. So, the bottom line is that maybe things aren’t as bad as they first seem. Watch the amazing video and remember, next time it rains, run out in the rain and get a little wet.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: 3 reasons why half of American workers are not using their vacation time\n\nArticle: Even Americans lucky enough to have paid time off are foregoing valuable vacation days to spend more time at the office, a national Bankrate survey of 1,000 employees shows.\nSome 52% of Americans say they won't be using all of their paid time off this year. They're often leaving seven days or more on the table, especially in regions like the South and the Midwest.\nIs America's culture of \"workaholism\" to blame? Partly, the survey shows.\nThe good news is that the top reason workers claimed they did not use all of their vacation days in 2016 was because they were saving them to use in 2017.\nAbout a third of respondents said that they plan on taking advantage of the fact that their company lets them roll over unused days. (Though, who knows? They may have said that last year too.)\nThe other reasons given confirm that many U.S. workers feel bound to their jobs.\nAbout a quarter of workers say they simply work too much and can't afford to take time off, while just over 15 percent say they actively enjoy working and prefer it to vacation.\nIt's good to remember that more time on the job doesn't necessarily translate to better performance at the job.\n\"Without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick — all of which have a direct impact on their work performance,\" says Sarah Berger, personal finance expert and \"The Cashlorette\" at Bankrate.com.\nSo consider taking your vacation, even if you just recharge at home. But if you can't, and would still like a way to de-stress in your off hours, consider taking up a hobby.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Why Russia has two St. Patrick’s days this year\n\nArticle: Informally, Russia has long marked St. Patrick's Day, joining the rest of the world in the March 17 celebration of Irish culture that includes lots of green and lots of drinking. This year, however, the Russian Orthodox Church is doing something different.\nIt's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time — but on March 30.\nEarlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West.\nDespite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync.\nThis means that the day of St. Patrick's death — March 17 in the Gregorian calendar — falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church.\nThe March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them. Russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. More than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in Moscow, which will take place on March 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to Ireland that take place March 15 to 26.\nIn a statement given to the Govorit Moskva radio station, the Irish government said it was glad the Russian Orthodox Church had made the decision. \"We hope to see our friends in Moscow on all of our Irish events in the next two weeks,\" said Arthur Hendrick, consul at the Irish Embassy in Moscow.\nFor members of the Orthodox faith, celebrating two St. Patrick's days may not be an option: March 17 falls in the middle of the Orthodox observance of Lent, when many religious Russians abstain from alcohol. Father Igor Fomin, head of a church at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, told Tass news agency that getting drunk in honor of a saint is like being heavily intoxicated at your mother’s gravesite.\n\"I am very happy that our St. Patrick’s Day falls on a different date, that way the traditions associated with it, that are strictly cultural and not religious can be ignored,\" Fomin said.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This means that the day of St. Patrick's death — March 17 in the Gregorian calendar — falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The strange word everyone is saying\/texting\n\nArticle: Not long after noticing friends and coworkers using \"slash\" in everyday conversation, I started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time.\nEither spelled out in five characters (\"slash\") or just one (\"\/\"), I saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways. But they weren't.\nIt was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.\nAfter so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8\/30\/2014\") and fractions (\"3\/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and\/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.\nGrammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.\nEnglish speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend\/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse\/backpack\/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"\n\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.\n\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"\nUsage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and\/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"\nTell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"\nWhile it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.\nThe slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")\nIn digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China.\nBreakfast slash lunch! Yum! @ Max's Restaurant, SM Mall of Asia http:\/\/t.co\/oSSwgVkLA4 — Uriel Yu Medellin (@itsmeuriel) August 4, 2014\nBut will it stick around?\nWe can't say. To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and\/or admit new members.\"\nCorrection: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: [The Guardian] Why did Croatia fans disrupt their Euro 2016 match against Czech Republic?\n\nArticle: Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.Please install Adobe Flash TM and try again. Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.\nWhy would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? And why would they then start a fight among themselves?\nThey are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.\nThey claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation’s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation’s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case.\nLast year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs.\nMany fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair – as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet – and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long – and at the moment unsuccessful – campaign to have them removed via the legal system.\nCroatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday’s match.\nSome radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football.\nTheir aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this.\nAmong the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. Croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the Czech Republic . \"Maybe it would be best if we don’t play at all,\" said Ivan Perisic, who scored the opening goal for Croatia. \"Maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play.\"\nThe coach, Ante Cacic, added: \"We are all to blame. Let’s not start washing our hands from it.\"\nHe is right, nothing will be won by people in authority not taking control of this ugly situation. The fear, however, is that no one will give in: not the top people at CFF, nor the ultras who are so fed up with them.\nAnd, ultimately, the losers will be the players and the supporters who would love nothing more than having their national team back.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption.

Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster.\n\"By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.\"\nShould any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates.\n\"We’re really happy for Michael that he’s made the decision to announce this, and we’re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,\" Pinkel said in a statement. \"Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he’s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn’t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we’re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn’t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don’t think there’s any way he has the type of season he put together.\"\nOne of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter.\nShout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam. Though its old news to us its a Great move by a great guy. Wish u much success in the future! — Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014\nNever cared if Michael was gay... As long as he put that pass rush on the QB and made my job easier i didnt give a damn... — Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014\nSam had been planning on coming out publicly before the NFL Draft but he had initially intended for the news to break after the NFL Combine, according to Outsports' behind-the-scenes look at the announcement. His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality.\n\"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\"\nWanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.\nI want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! — Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014\nWhile Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.\n\"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.\"\nAlthough several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A. Galaxy of the MLS.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Michael Sam END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: And the best country for women is...\n\nArticle: In a year that has brought us national conversations about working women, leaning in and whether or not the patriarchy is in fact \"dead,\" you might expect that all this talk signaled a real improvement for gender equality in the United States.\nAccording to the 2013 Global Gender Gap report released on Oct. 24 by the World Economic Forum, that, unfortunately, is not the case. In fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the U.S.\nThe Global Gender Gap Report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas:\n1. Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs.\n2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education.\n3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years.\n4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates.\nEach country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings. According to the report's authors, the index scores represent the \"percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men.\"\nThis year the United States ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the U.S. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373. Unfortunately, our ranking and score have both decreased since 2011. That year, the U.S. was ranked 17th, just behind the United Kingdom and just ahead of Canada, with a score of .7412.\nWhere the U.S. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress.\nAnd of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life. For example, it is illegal in both Nicaragua and the Philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy.\nAs always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the U.S. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done.\nHere are 22 countries that are more gender equal than the United States:\n1.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: How Stephen Hawking Has Lived So Long With ALS\n\nArticle: An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds\nEditor’s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nStephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.\nThe famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care.\nBut his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.\nBut like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.\nWhy has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.\nWhat is ALS—and is there more than one form of it?\nALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.\nIt's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.\nThere is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.\nThe other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.\nThose are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.\nOne of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.\nWhat has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?\nOne thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.\nLife expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.\nHas he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?\nJuvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.\nHe's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.\nHow frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?\nI would say probably less than a few percent.\nHow much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?\nIt's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.\nHawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?\nI don't believe that adds to longevity.\nALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments?\nBeginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.\nWhat does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?\nIt's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" juvenile-onset disorder END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Do YOU have high cholesterol? Here are 5 foods to eat and avoid\n\nArticle: High fat, low fat, no carb, more carb: when it comes to getting information on eating to manage high blood cholesterol, confusion reigns.\nWe checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol. \nThe verdict? Good news first! Eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol.\nThe bad news? Discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called LDL). Eating less lowers it.\nDo you know your blood cholesterol level? If you don't, ask your GP to check it. Over a third of Australian adults have high cholesterol.\n1. Eat legumes \nLegumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels.\nThe most recent Australian Health Survey found fewer than one in five Australians ate them on the day of the survey.\nThe results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together. \nThe data showed LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day. \nThis is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans.\nPulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. They lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways. \nThe soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel.\nLegumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. This means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal.\n2. Eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads \nPlant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts. \nThey are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk.\nPlant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver. \nThis 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood.\nA review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol.\nThe type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important. \nA meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and LDL cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil.\n3. Eat nuts \nNuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary. \nIn a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for LDL.\nIt didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction. \nPeople with higher LDL cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement. \nOne caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kJ), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day.\n4. Use olive oil \nOlive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. Olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat.\nMore than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice.\nA review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised LDL (a type of LDL), with no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol.\nIn contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the Mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or Mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat). \nAfter 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls.\nIn a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks. \nResearchers found total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil.\nThe reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. Switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol.\n5. Avoid junk food \nIn our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols.\nBut the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods. \nThe benefits of making these changes? They lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure.\nA big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 51, 000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010). \nAfter four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'.\nThose who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk. You can check your diet quality using our Healthy Eating Quiz.\nWhen it comes to heart disease risk factors, get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked next time you see your GP.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Apple iPhone 7 has two nasty surprises\n\nArticle: Questions over supply remain and there is no doubt ’s new iPhones are already proving immensely popular. But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase...\n‘Great Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features \/ biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.\nNasty Surprise #1: Goodbye Sapphire?\nThe first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens:\nThe revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs’ scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire.\nHe concludes: \"we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire.\"\nAnd here’s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when\/if the company responds.\nNote: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it’s possible sapphire is still used there.\nNasty Surprise #2: New Home Button, New Limitations\nThe controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by Myke Hurley, eagle eyed founder of RelayFM, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure.\nThis means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. As he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt\/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing.\nThat’s right, you get nothing. Hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves.\nThere are a couple of ways around this. Firstly you can invest in ‘touchscreen gloves’ which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that’s a bogus claim that these don’t work, but I’ve tried two pairs and they do).\nSecondly you can setup AssistiveTouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. Feel free to insert your joke of choice here.\nDesigned By Apple - For Apple?\nAll of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7’s biggest external changes and who they really help the most.\nFor example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iPhone design for Apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. But the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from iFixit illustrates below).\nI’m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. Personally a far bigger battery would’ve been top of my list.\nThen there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card.\nThis despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.\nYes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn’t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea...\n___\nMore On Forbes\nApple iOS 10 Has 25 Great Secret Features\nApple iOS 10.0.1: Should You Upgrade?\nApple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature\niPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference?\niPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" #1: Goodbye Sapphire?\n#2: New Home Button, New Limitations END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: \"Pluto’s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn't » Second Nexus\n\nArticle: The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.\nFinding a Dark Moon\nUntil this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"\nMakemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.\nMK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.\nPart of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he\nthought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There’s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they’d made a major discovery.\nThe Moon in the Data\nIt is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.\nHowever, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.\nThe New, Improved Makemake System\nWhile MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an\nopportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" \nMakemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto’s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.\nLooking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" a charcoal-black moon END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: She Put On 100 Pounds In Just Two Years. Doctors Couldn't Find A Reason, Until She Found It Herself\n\nArticle: The one thing any teen doesn’t want to have happen to them is rapid, unexplained weight gain.\nBut Lizzie Denison-Ward, a now 20-year-old girl, had this happen to her for two years. She told the Daily Mail her story.\nShe started gaining weight in November 2013. She couldn’t tell why, since she had always been slender. She went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years.\nWhen she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories.\nSo she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. Not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face.\nShe decided to do some private research. And when she paid for an MRI scan herself after doctors wouldn’t help her, she found that there was a 4 mm tumor in her brain.\nThe tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing's disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her.\nBy the time she had the MRI, she had gone up ten dress sizes.\nLizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn’t without psychological cost.\n\"I believed the doctors after I first saw them,\" said Lizzie, \"but over time I thought there was something else wrong because I’ve always been thin.\"\nHer mother worried about her too.\nShe kept seeing her doctor, but to no avail. \"No one could get to the bottom of it and find out what it was. It was a real low time and I was feeling depressed.\"\nNow that she’s finally had it removed, she’s so glad to be rid of the problem. \"After I found out it was a tumor I was more relieved than anything. I was just glad I was right and I wasn’t just making it up.\"\nFive weeks later, Lizzie has already lost 21 pounds. She has medication to regulate her hormone levels, and she’s back to a healthy lifestyle that’s causing the weight to melt away.\n\"The tumor took over my whole body and now I can finally go back to living like a normal student.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 mm tumor in her brain END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Donald Trump just made an extremely important promise. It’s one of his worst yet.\n\nArticle: THE MORNING PLUM:\nBelieve it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications.\nThe near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.\nTo get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.\nTrump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.\nAs I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and\/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.\nThis deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.\nSanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:\nClimate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016\nAnd:\nAs a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016\nIt’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.\nIt is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" END"}

Other highlights include a unique singing tree in town (come closer to the tree and you'll see it is actually filled with children singing Christmas songs) and the release of 800 floating candles into the River Limmat on December 22.\nThen head to Zermatt for an alpine experience. It's car-free, leaving the snow-covered streets gorgeously illuminated for the holidays. And the Matterhorn never fails to mesmerize. There also aren't any large crowds at this time, making this a sublime place to have a Silent Night, Holy Night moment filled with love and gratitude.\nWhere to stay: The Dolder Grand (Zurich); Le Petit Cervin or the Bellerive (Zermatt).\n3. Christmas in Santa's home: Finland\nNorthern Lights, Finland. Photo credit: Visit Finland.\nEveryone knowns Santa lives in Finnish Lapland and it's time you pay him a visit for all those times he came to your house. At least that's according to Visit Finland, Finland's official tourism promoter which, together with Finnair, has been recently courting Asian visitors  to visit the country.\nLapland, the largest and northernmost region of Finland, has 190,000 reindeers, 749 mountains and one Santa Claus. While there is a Santa's Village there, this amusement park may be too commercialized for some. Best to check out hotels and resorts that offer a more authentic experience where the highlights can include visits to husky and reindeer farms, hunts for the Northern Lights with a guide, snow mobile safaris and winter fishing.\nFinland will mark its 100th year of independence next year and to mark the occasion, Visit Finland has launched a StopOver Finland initiative comprising 50 easily reachable packages\/services lasting five hours to five days. It's also worth mentioning that Finland is the shortest connection between Europe and Asia, giving you even more reason to make the comparatively short trip.\nExperiences available to Asian tourists include running tours of Helsinki, a two-day package to see the Northern Lights and a one-day trip incorporating two capital cities, Tallinn and Helsinki.\n4. Christmas-at-sea: Genting Dream\nParty all night at Zouk on board Genting Dream. Photo credit: Dream Cruises.\nIf you're after something different, why not eschew your boarding pass for a spot on a cruise? Hop onto Genting Dream, the first cruise ship of Asia's first luxury cruise line, Dream Cruises. It sails out from Hong Kong or Guangzhou in the south of China, and takes you to scenic destinations in Vietnam including Ha Long Bay and Danang.\nAs with all firsts, it's out to impress so you can expect keen service and a sparkling new vessel with such a wide range of facilities and entertainment it could be considered a destination on its own. This includes a waterslide park, Zouk nightclub (famous for its Singapore and Kuala Lumpur locations), more than 35 restaurant and bar concepts, the first Penfolds flagship wine vault at sea and a Dreamscapes enrichment program that will offer talks and presentations from esteemed speakers. Joining the cruise on December 10, for instance, is American astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, who will deliver a three-part lecture.\n5. Break the bank Christmas: The Maldives\nA Garden Villa at Cheval Blanc, Randheli. Photo credit: Cheval Blanc, Randheli.\nThe best time to visit the Maldives is from the second half of December to April, making it another destination pick that's perfect for the holiday season.\nIf you've been rewarded with a bonus as fat as Santa himself, treat yourself to a stay at Cheval Blanc Randheli. Owned by LVMH, it's one of the most stylish resorts in the Maldives with its contemporary minimalist design (by architect Jean Michel-Gathy), spaciousness (not just the size of the room; the resort's spa occupies another whole adjacent island), and extensive facilities to suit any tastes or needs (you have your own majordome for the entire stay who caters to your likes\/dislikes and ensures your day runs just as you wish).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie\n\nArticle: I n the Superman comics there is a character called Bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There’s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.\nIn today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.\nAnd yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC’s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.\nIt may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi’s Spiderman films).\nThe present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis’ David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.\nIt’s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson’s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, Hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).\nIf Heath Ledger’s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.\nWhile today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.\nTwo years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi’s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright’s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn’t know the half of it.\nPublished 21 Aug 2016\n\n###\n\n","completion":" none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: What Will Humans Look Like 100,000 Years From Now?\n\nArticle: How will humans look 10,000-100,000 years from now? originally appeared on Quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.\nAnswer by Matan Shelomi, Organismic and Evolutionary Biologist, on Quora:\nAll life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesn't stop. As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes.\nThousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.\nAnother famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too.\nAnother example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.\nOur mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet.\nDarwin's theory of natural selection evolves.\nSo what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? Even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. Ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes. Who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence?\nThis question originally appeared on Quora. Ask a question, get a great answer.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Does your iq correlate with the rap music you listen to?\n\nArticle: So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I’ve seen tweets before that have told me that I’m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.\nFirst of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I’ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross’ God Forgives, I Don’t. What haven’t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).\nSo if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD’s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics\/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence.\nNow, I can’t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I’m not considering the force that is Death Grips’ Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I’m not) is Lil Yachty’s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I’ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What’s wrong with putting Kodak Black’s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar’s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist?\nIn fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what I thought. It’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.\nThere will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I’m guilty of it as much as I’m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It’s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There’s a reason Common isn’t ever requested at the bar. I don’t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song?\nHip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn’t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn’t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes. A person’s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person’s brain power. So stop hating, throw on some Lil Yachty, and don’t be afraid to like it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart.

These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across.\n\"Glial cells\" are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons.

Your brain’s pruning gardeners are called \"microglial cells.\" They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune?\nResearchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse.\nThis is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more.\nHave you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.\nWhen you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections.

Don't ask if she has chosen a name\nThis might not seem like a big deal, but it can be to those who haven't thought of a name yet or those that have, but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinions. \nGone are the days when we would name our child John or Jane, in recent times there's been a general trend to more creative names, such as Wolf or Apple. \nProblems arise when she tells you what she's going to name her child, and you can't resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision. \nHearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be. It's easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born. \nI've found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time, even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first.\n3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant\nThis often happens with women I see who are also in high flying jobs.

Whether or not you've seen her maternal side doesn't mean she doesn't have one! \nAnd whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a 'maternal woman' doesn't mean she won't be a brilliant mother.\n4. Don't tell her she's getting bigger (and bigger)\nWhile seeing a friend's bump grow can be really exciting, don't comment on the size or shape. \nMany of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds. \nA pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there's no need to be constantly reminding her that she's huge, big, or massive. Even if she's looking a large she doesn't need to hear it.\n5. Don't tell her she's not big enough\nFollowing on from the previous comment, it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them, 'are you gaining enough weight?' \nYou may think you're paying a mama-to-be a compliment when you say, 'You're so tiny' or 'I can barely see your belly!' but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby.\n6. Don't congratulate her on social media\nIf someone tells you they're pregnant, they have chosen to tell you and not your friends, family and random followers on social media. \nThe decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you, therefore, don't instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they haven't told yet, or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready.\n7. Don't act like she's sick\nAlthough pregnancy is in a way a medical condition, pregnancy is not an illness. \nPregnant woman can still have fun, go out, exercise and more, attend meetings, head departments and in today's day and age, where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses, building extensions and becoming mothers, they last thing they want is to be treated differently. \nEvery woman is different, some may have severe symptoms, some may find pregnancy a breeze, only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take. \nThat said, pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube.\n8. Don't tell her labour horror stories\nWhenever anyone's having a baby, others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour. \nBut telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency c-section and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful. \nLabour is a process and the great news is that in today's world, with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control, most women get through it, and usually, once the baby arrives, memories of labour fade away. \nIt is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories, so don't share them.\n9. Do tell her she's going to be just fine\nPregnancy can be a scary time for women. Their lives are about to change and many fear how they will think\/feel\/cope 'on the other side'. \nThe bottom line is that all women try their best and most women, even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive. \nIt might take some longer than others to take to motherhood, but that is understandable as there's a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby, and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle, whether that's other children, elderly relatives, high flying careers, evening courses, husbands and everything else. \nIf you throw in fear of post-partum depression and then the very real experience of having post-partum depression, it's no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead. \nBut I've met thousands of mothers over the years and you know, they've nearly all been absolutely fine, grown into their new role admirably, coped well and become wonderful parents. This is what she needs to hear. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. Don't touch her bump\n2. Don't ask if she has chosen a name\n3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant\n4.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave in France\n\nArticle: In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.\nThese weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They’ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\"\nShe knew that Rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I’m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It’s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.\nAnd if Rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The future of fast food has arrived and it's a one-of-a-kind experience\n\nArticle: We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.\nEatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience.\nThe tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots.\nInstead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? \nThe concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.\nWhile one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\"\nMuch like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.\nTo the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. \nSince there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth.\nRight before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.\nTBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.\nThe process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.\nThough I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen.\nVery ominous.\nDespite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\"\nFirst-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\"\nAs of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick.\"\nWith the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.\nWhile this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it’s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy. So it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\" \nBryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said.\nHer boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways.\"\nTo get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\"\nNederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned. \nMarsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said. \nThough the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)\n\"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days. We’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said.\nWhat's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" robots END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: 'Please value life'\n\nArticle: A new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in Taiwan. It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy.\nPerhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time.\n\"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers.\nAs a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan.\nThe shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down.\nOn 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan.\nTaiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short.\nBut people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure.\nYou might also be interested in\nIn an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down.\n\"I went home and cried all night,\" she said.\nBut it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\".\nShelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters.\n\"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers.\n\"But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough.\"\nHigh kill rate\nTaiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce.\nIn reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions.\nBut the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed.\nIn 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness.\nIn the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down.\n\"We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the 'humane room'.\n\"When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad.\"\nNo psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan.\nThe Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter.\nBut a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide.\n\"She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,\" said Ms Lai.\nIn the letter, Ms Chien wrote: \"I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.\"\nThe irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out.\nNewspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing.\nSome accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility.\nMany believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law.\nThe chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately.\nAnd even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered.\n\"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\"\nSome Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell.\nShort-term measures\nMs Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force.\nFrom 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (£100).\nThe authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy.\nThe government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures.\nActivists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays.\nPerhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: How to Fall Asleep in Under a Minute\n\nArticle: Tech savvy . Culturally aware . Underemployed . Spiritual but not religious .\nThese are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the \"Milliennial Generation,\" which is also sometimes referred to as Generation Y. Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless .\nThe correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia.\nAccording to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures.\nWhy does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body’s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate.\nFight or Flight or... Sleep?\nThese are, in short, all individual components of the body’s intrinsic and universally acknowledged \"fight-or-flight\" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night.\nBest-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes:\n\"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\"\nBecause the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath.\nThat being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies.\nHow to Do The \"4-7-8′′ Exercise\nDr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere.\nHere is how you do the exercise:\nPlace the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.\nIn a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.\nAlina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding.\nWhen Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly.\nThe 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the \"performance killer\" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: You'll Never Guess What Else Gives You The Munchies\n\nArticle: Until now you thought that your love for marijuana was the reason for your munchies, but you’ll never guess what else can actually give you the munchies. According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.\nJust by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.\nConducting the study\nThe University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.\nAfter the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.\nSleep deprivation and obesity\nIt has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.\nThe scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.\nThe endocannabinoid system\nFinally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.\nEndocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"\nSo it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it.\nDo you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived?

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Scarlett Johansson could make Oscar history\n\nArticle: Spike Jonze's \"Her\" made its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on Saturday night, and the Warner Bros. release could factor into the Oscar race like no other film ever before. That's because Scarlett Johansson -- who co-stars with Joaquin Phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\nJonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional.\n\"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.\n\"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.)\nWith regard to Johansson's Oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. As Deadline.com's Pete Hammond pointed out, non-traditional \"flesh-and-blood\" acting roles -- like Andy Serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as Gollum in the \"Lord of the Rings\" films -- are normally ignored by Academy Awards voters. Johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation.\nFor what it's worth, Warner Bros. and \"Her\" producer Megan Ellison are planning a full-court press for Johansson's awards campaign. Ellison tweeted this in response to Hammond's post on Sunday:\n@NikkiFinke @Deadline\nScarlett is eligible, deserves the recognition, and we are going to campaign for her — Megan Ellison (@meganeellison) October 13, 2013\n\"Her\" is out in theaters on Dec. 18.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The fascinating tradition that sets baseball apart\n\nArticle: There are several competing theories as to why, in the middle of the seventh inning, every baseball game comes to a stop so everyone can stretch, sing a really old song and take a breather. But for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique.\nHere are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment.\nTHE MUSIC\nAside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films.\nTHE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS\nThe origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit.\nAnother theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof.\nPresident William Howard Taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in Washington in April of 1910. (Photo by Mark Rucker\/Transcendental Graphics, Getty Images)\nTHE CAMARADERIE\nDave Ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of \"Beyond the Cheers,\" believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything.\n\"It's actually taken on its own life, depending on the team,\" Ferguson told HuffPost. \"The players look at it as a break from the game itself. And it's appreciated by the fans.\"\nTony La Russa: \"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history.\" (AP)\nTHE TRADITION\n\"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history,\" Tony La Russa, the three-time World Series-winning manager, told The Huffington Post. La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay.\nTHE RELIEF\nBaseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies.\nIchiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.\nAnd the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. This past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes. And during those nearly three hours, actual baseball happens for only 18 minutes -- including balls in play and wild pitches -- according to a study by The Wall Street Journal.\nRelive The Longest Game In Baseball History:\nEmail me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The Crazy Cooking Hack that Slashes the Calories in Rice by Half\n\nArticle: Whether you think rice is a friend or foe to your diet, there's one thing we can all agree on: It's delicious. (If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool—they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more.\nNew research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent.\nLike I said: Seriously cool.\nThe researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch—one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body.\nThis is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body.\nBonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found.\nNo word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. For now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Wondering if you can get pregnant during a pregnancy? 🤔  Dr Karl has the answer for you. #science\n\nArticle: Can humans become pregnant while already pregnant? It's possible, but rare.\nCan a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? In other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development?\nThe technical term for this is superfetation. In humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon.\nTwo thousand years ago, that great Greek thinker Aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare.\nAristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares.\nIt was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then — while pregnant — had conceived a second time.\nThere was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, Aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. And he was right.\nNormally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant.\nThe first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg.\nDr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation.\nThe second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg.\nThird, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall.\nEven so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. About 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the Australian swamp wallaby.\nSuperfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature.\nA typical case is that of Julia Grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from Arkansas.\nMs Grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child.\nBut amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 — a few weeks apart. The Daily Mail claimed that, in a \"desperate and final attempt to have children of their own\", the couple had given it one last try.\nThis is a curious use of the word desperate.\nPossible superfetation has been observed in cows\nI might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as \"a desperate and final attempt\" to get pregnant.\nIt makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate.\nAnyhow, Ms Grovenburg was pregnant — but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac. But one was much larger and more developed than the other.\nAs the ultrasounds scans mounted up for Ms Grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other.\nIn other words, Mrs Grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first.\nNow we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. We would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that.\nThese scans would need to document a series of changes — starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks.\nPeople don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get.\nBut there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation. Female European brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant. This means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season.\nFor humans, more babies each breeding cycle isn't always a plus — especially if you're trying to get a good night's sleep.\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.\nIt's a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while it's rare, it can happen.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The technical term for this is superfetation.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: Pikachu Just Got A New Name And People Are P****d!\n\nArticle: Well, I guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.\nWith Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:\nNow Nintendo wants to unify them: Pokémon in Greater China will be officially called 精靈寶可夢, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Pokémon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was 寵物小精靈 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was 神奇寶貝, Magic Babies.\nThis probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists.\nHong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name!\nThat's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu\nPikachu was originally translated as 比卡超 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named 皮卡丘 (Pikaqiu). While the name 皮卡丘 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn’t sound the same at all.\nFans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Pikaqiu END"}

Of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the American Beverage Association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies.\nDue to the recency of those findings (they circulated in June 2014), the results haven’t been totally disproven. However, a study conducted at the University of Nottingham published earlier this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition offers some contradiction.\nThese results won’t be surprising to much of the population, especially as the positive effects of diet beverages is called more and more frequently into question against full-sugar drinks, never mind sugar- and calorie-free water. However, there is a set of the population (one that the American Beverage Association is trying to no doubt grow) that believes diet sodas are at least as effective, if not more so, than water in losing weight.\nA sample of 89 women who usually drank diet beverages, with BMIs of 27-40 (slightly to moderately overweight), were parsed into two groups: those who would continue to drink diet beverages after eating their lunch and those who would replace their diet drinks with water. They did so five times per week for 24 weeks.\nThe group drinking the water after their meals had a larger average weight loss than those who stuck with the diet beverages, and also improved the water group’s insulin resistance, the benefit of which could be leveraged in various medical treatments.\nThis is among the first studies to offer a rebuttal to the ABA-funded study, and it suggests, as many would believe, diet beverages do not beat water when it comes to losing weight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" water END"}

The likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\"We suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack),\" Dr. Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center and colleagues wrote.\n\"Men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. Snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads,\" they added.\nThe team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died.\nA single day of snowfall raised a man's risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent.\nEight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day.\nWomen were not more likely to either have heart attacks or to die of them after snow, the team found.\nSnow shoveling is hard. It's not a daily activity, and it strains the heart, Auger's team said. People often exhale hard with their mouths closed while lifting a heavy shovel full of snow, a dangerous habit called the Valsalva maneuver, they noted.\nUsing the arms intensively and repetitively, especially while standing upright, can also raise the risk that a piece will break off from a clogged artery, the researchers noted. Cold temperatures make blood vessels constrict, which adds to the danger.\nIt might not only be shoveling that does it. People using snow blowers have also been reported to have higher rates of heart attack, the Canadian team noted.\nThe National Safety Council has some advice for how to safely shovel snow:\nDo not shovel after eating or while smoking Take it slow and stretch out before you begin Push the snow rather than lifting it If you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel Lift with your legs, not your back Do not work to the point of exhaustion Talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease Stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease Stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest END"}

{"prompt":"Clickbait: The 'Batman v Superman' Easter Egg Almost Everybody Missed\n\nArticle: ‘Batman v Superman’ (Warner Bros.)\nBy Jessica Derschowitz , Entertainment Weekly\nThe film’s set photographer, Clay Enos, confirmed a new Easter egg that explains why (spoiler alert) Batman was able to weaken Superman during their titular battle by firing kryptonite gas at the Man of Steel.\nCouldn’t Superman have used his X-ray vision to see what was in the Dark Knight’s canisters? Well, as pointed out by an eagle-eyed viewer (via Screen Rant ), the canisters Bruce Wayne\/Batman used have \"Pb\" — the abbreviation for lead in the Periodic Table of Elements — etched on them.\nLead, as Superman fans know, can block the superhero’s X-ray vision. When asked by another fan if that was intentional on director Zack Snyder’s part, Enos affirmed that it was. \"Nothing happens by accident in Zack’s movies,\" he tweeted\nThe next film to arrive in the DC movie universe will be the Gal Gadot-starring Wonder Woman, in theaters June 2.

{"prompt":"Clickbait: KFC’s secret ingredient is 'the most under-appreciated spice' in the world\n\nArticle: Colonel Sanders' nephew recently revealed what he claims is the secret recipe for KFC chicken. Although KFC has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub.\nThe famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper.\n\"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s.\nFood scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe.\n\"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction.\nBut he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense.\n\"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said.\nWhite pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade.\nWhite pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets.\nThe upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting.\n\"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says.\nKFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows:\n2 cups white flour plus 2\/3 tbsp. salt\n1\/2 tbsp. thyme\n1\/2 tbsp. basil\n1\/3 tbsp. oregano\n1 tbsp. celery salt\n1 tbsp. black pepper\n1 tbsp. dried mustard\n4 tbsp. paprika\n2 tbsp. garlic salt\n1 tbsp. ground ginger\n3 tbsp. white pepper\nAs great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness.\nAnd that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" white pepper END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot\n\nArticle: I was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex. The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let’s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, \"Having your prostate milked is awesome.\"\nI nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: \"It’s the male g-spot.\" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: \"Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.\"\nWell, then. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners’ self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.\nThen, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher’s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It’s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before — just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I’ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women’s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.\nBut I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn’t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.\nWithout solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don’t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop’s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.\nPart of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It’s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I’ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I’ve actually heard use the irritating I’m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt — no homo\") — before I wallop them over the head. They haven’t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they’ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person’s sexual orientation.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" anal sex END"}
{"prompt":"Clickbait: 9 things Elizabeth Taylor taught us about the art of love\n\nArticle: Sure, she was married eight times, but there’s no denying that Elizabeth Taylor was a woman who knew how to live and love.\nWith her joie de vivre and insatiable appetite for the opposite sex, Taylor had the kind of love life most of us can only dream about. She lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011.\nIn honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from Liz, the fiercest old Hollywood dame of all. \n\"I don’t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. I am not and couldn’t be,\" the mom of four once remarked. And it was true — the actress was anything but ordinary. While her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for Life and Look magazines, La Liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was NBD at a time when divorce wasn’t nearly as accepted as it is now. She was seriously a woman before her time.\nTaylor’s fifth (and sixth!) husband Richard Burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries:\n\"She is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography,\" he wrote. \"She can be arrogant and willful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!\"\nYeah, we think we could get used to someone fawning over us like that.\nYou would think things would have been awkward between Elizabeth Taylor and the late Debbie Reynolds after Eddie Fisher left Reynolds for Taylor (the couple’s longtime friend) in 1959. Instead, the two women remained pals until Taylor’s death in March 2011.\n\"Women liked her and men adored her — my husband included — and her love for her children is enduring,\" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly after Taylor’s passing. \"People always assume you’re going to carry a grudge, but I don’t do that. We passed through that with time.\"\nTaylor reportedly accepted a pave diamond-heart necklace after one of her legendary screaming matches with Burton. It would have been rude not to accept, right?\n\"I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up,\" Dame Elizabeth once remarked. \"It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.\" We know the type. Still, if Taylor taught us anything about love, it’s that there are plenty of fish in the sea, so if the person you’re with doesn’t think you’re young or pretty enough, tell them to get lost.\nDisagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship. Taylor and Burton were so prepared for them, they would reportedly rent three suites when they checked into hotels ― one above and another below their own. That way, the couple figured, their neighbors would be spared if one of their infamous lovers’ quarrels broke out.\n\"I’ve always admitted that I’m ruled by my passions,\" Taylor said. No kidding. When it came to love, Liz was insatiable — so much so that the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\" when she took up with Burton, her married co-star in the 1966 film \"Cleopatra.\" After that, the couple lived out a totally epic whirlwind romance: marrying in 1964, making up after epic fights time and time again, and eventually divorcing in 1974... only to remarry in a private African ceremony sixteen months later.\n\"Maybe we loved each other too much,\" Elizabeth said, as if such a thing were possible.\nBut what if a relationship doesn’t work out? We’ve always been partial to Taylor’s advice on getting over someone: \"Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.\" 🙌\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I don’t pretend to be an ordinary housewife\nPeople always assume you’re going to carry a grudge, but I don’t do that\nthere are plenty of fish in the sea\nDisagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship\nI’ve always admitted that I’m ruled by my passions END"}

The files are encrypted with a code so strong it’s unbreakable, even by governments. If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies. \"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the U.S. government if it were released,\" said Declan McCullagh, chief political correspondent for CNET, a CBS company.\nNot long after the mysterious tweets appeared in October 2016, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous asserted that they were not indicative of harm coming to Assange — he was presumably, fine and the tweets were a form of data integrity verification:\nClarification: Wikileaks tweeted out sha256sum coded messages, not deadman keys. Assange is fine as far as we know. Carry on. — Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) October 17, 2016\nA Gizmodo article described the series of tweets and their less ominous potential purpose:\nMuch as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight. \"Pre-commitment\" in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes. The same strategy was used by Tor Project developer Andrea Shepard in a warning shot that may have helped reveal years of Jacob Applebaum’s sexual misconduct. Likewise, Edward Snowden tweeted (and quickly deleted) a similar code in August, though its meaning remains uncertain. A torrent file and accompanying SHA-512 hash was even used by someone on Reddit’s r\/SilkRoad to share sensitive forum information. The tweets from Wikileaks appear to be in line with these prior examples—and surely a true \"dead man’s switch\" unleashing all the data Assange currently possesses would amount to much more than three measly leaks.\nWikiLeaks regularly tweets about Assange’s status and whereabouts, and shortly after the cryptic tweets were posted, WikiLeaks proclaimed that a \"state actor\" had cut off Assange’s Internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange had remained since seeking asylum from that country in June 2012:\nJulian Assange’s internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party.
