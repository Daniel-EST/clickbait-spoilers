{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s fate could hang on a single word\n\nArticle: © REUTERS/Laura Segall Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announces newly launched program aimed at providing security around schools in Anthem, Arizona, January 9, 2013. PHOENIX — A single word — \"intentionally\" — could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution.\nIn finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona’s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges.\nArpaio has acknowledged violating Snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional.\nIn the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio.\n\"The Defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote.\nIn a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice.\nTwo years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people.\nHe later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly.\nIn Friday’s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count.\n\"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\"\nIn hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America’s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge.\nA lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see Arpaio reelected.\nArpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined.\nIn his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos.\nSnow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives.\nLongtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign.\n\"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,\" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday.\nThe ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff’s office.\n\"Strong remedies are needed to protect the community’s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,\" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. \"Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.\"\nThe ruling Friday was one of Arpaio’s most serious defeats, but it doesn’t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in November.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"intentionally\"\ncould transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdresser\n\nArticle: Here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdresserMore\nRemembering how much you’re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard — what do current trends dictate? Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands.\nBelow, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist — and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later — no tip necessary.\nIf you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you’re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what’s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment.\nOffering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along.\nAs for your stylist’s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20.\n\"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle.\nTry to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it’s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.\nAlso, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.\nIf you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s.\nAs for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!\nFinally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 20% END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: \"Harry Potter\" alums reunite for new movie\n\nArticle: The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others.\nThe legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa.\nHuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him.\nWhat are you up to today?\nRickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England.\nGrint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it.\nAre you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy?\nGrint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it.\nWere you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie?\nRickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they’d all started in a club on the Bowery.\nGrint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn’t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn’t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible.\nDid you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie?\nRickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn’t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the ‘60s and the ‘70s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that.\nGrint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that.\nDid you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point?\nGrint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me.\nNot knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters?\nRickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me.\nGrint: Yeah, there wasn’t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you’re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it’s quite a challenge.\nSo he was on set the whole time?\nGrint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive.\nDid he give you any notes while filming?\nGrint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time.\nWas this movie your first instance of nudity on camera?\nGrint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.\nWere you comfortable with that? How did that go down?\nGrint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn’t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn’t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don’t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There’s quite a lot of ass in the film.\nYou had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera?\nRickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That’s really difficult.\nGrint: It’s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It’s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things.\nOnce you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying?\nGrint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I’ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music.\nIs music something you’d ever pursue?\nGrint: I don’t know, probably not. I’ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it’s never going to happen.\nAlan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character?\nRickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I’ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It’s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I’m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in \"Sense & Sensibility\" as I am any of those powerful characters. It’s just part of an actor’s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard.\nHow was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth \"Harry Potter\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint\nCBGB END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This popular soda could cure your hangovers scientists say:\n\nArticle: Most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and \"did-I-get-run-over-by-a-bus\" sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover.\nTo alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing Advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket?\nA group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\"\nAfter examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms.\nThe team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms.\nChemistry World explains it this way:\nSome of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body.\nThe Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH.\nSome beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects.\nOn the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde.\nThe researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet.\nEdzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results.\nDo you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by?

{"prompt": "Clickbait: You won't believe this stunning \"Harry Potter\" revelation about Professor McGonagall\n\nArticle: From reading J.K. Rowling‘s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.\nObversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort’s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn’t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall’s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?\nAs a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort’s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle’s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.\nAdditionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?\nTake note of Professor McGonagall’s wand. It’s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.\nIt seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore’s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, \"angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as \"what was rightfully his\". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: J.J. Abrams has an answer on if there will be a post-credits scene in the new 'Star Wars'\n\nArticle: In the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular. The films made by Marvel Studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the \"X-Men\" franchise movies as well as the latest \"Terminator.\" Because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the \"Star Wars\" series as well... but now J.J. Abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation.\nThe subject came up when Abrams was on stage for a \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" press conference held today in Los Angeles. The filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or Easter Egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying:\n\"No, there’s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\"\nThose of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn’t happening – so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.\nPost-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits – but I can’t say that I’m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won’t have one. After all, they aren’t exactly part of the franchise’s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it’s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it.\nSurely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they’ll all get over it fairly quickly. After all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we’re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" As always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and J.J.

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?\nThe main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact.

Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.\nIn Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.\nBy contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.\nThe Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.\n\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.\nSince the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.\nAerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.\n\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.\nHis research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.\nIf the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.\nNaled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.\nMiami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.\nZika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.\nZika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.\nAlthough spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said. Yet some environmentalists are not OK with any effects to land and sea, he said.\n\"It's a balancing act,\" Phillips said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Dibrom END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Do birds fart?\n\nArticle: Have you ever wondered, \"Do birds fart?\" No? Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.\nThey don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?\nAs Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.\nBut Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.\nIn another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.\nOne of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.\nWeisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)\nIt’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.\nWithout a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.\nBut even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?\nAs far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.\nLastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " They don’t fart END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The one morning work mistake you can't recover from\n\nArticle: Rolling into the office around 9:30 a.m. every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full day's worth of work.\nA new study from the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later.\nPast studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning.\nBut the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done.\nIn the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee’s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings.\nBosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\"\nIn a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nThe researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias.\n\"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review.\nThis \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained. In a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like \"sunrise\") with words associated with conscientiousness (like \"industriousness\").\nAnother recent study covered by the New York Times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more \"traditional\" hours.\n\"Most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation,\" Erin Kelly, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Times. \"You are implicitly saying, ‘Most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.’ And that is where you have this stigma or career penalties.\"\nAlthough the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. That's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " starts later END"}

Seriously, if we could go back in time and tell our 5-year-old selves not to complain about nap time , we would. But there are lots of things that can throw you off your nighttime game.\nIf you have regular trouble catching z's, you've probably looked into taking melatonin supplements. After all, there are countless bottles stocking drugstore shelves. How much do you really know about them, though?\nWhat Is Melatonin?\nFor starters, melatonin is a For starters, melatonin is a hormone released by the brain that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm (aka your internal clock), explains David Lee, MD, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program. \"It's secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,\" he says. \"It's a natural hormone that makes us sleep, and the moment the light goes away, like in the evening, that's when our peak melatonin [is produced].\"\nAre Melatonin Pills Really Safe?\nSince they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of allergic reactions , not from the melatonin, but from the preservatives or additives,\" he says.

While these results haven't been replicated in humans, there also haven't been any good studies showing the long-term safety of melatonin pills, says Kothare.\nStill, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says. The important thing, Lee points out, is to take the correct amount.\n\"The biggest myth out there, especially for \"The biggest myth out there, especially for insomnia , is that more is better,\" says Lee. In fact, when it comes to melatonin, less is actually more because your body already makes it. He suggests taking 0.5 milligrams if you do decide to try it. If that dosage amount is difficult to track down, buy 1 milligram pills and cut them in half.\nThe bottom line: Unfortunately, there's not enough solid research out there on whether melatonin supplements are truly an effective and safe way to get to sleep. If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Rebekah Brooks is back with Rupert Murdoch, and this time it's digital\n\nArticle: \"This one.\"\nThose were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal.\nHe was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw.\nWhile Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.\nThat speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media.\nUpward mobility\nBrooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32.\nKnown as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana.\nAnother time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper — The Sunday Times — and then stole one of the paper's scoops.\nBrooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World.\nHaving risen to the top of Britain's media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron's communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal.\nA fall from the top, but not from grace\nBrooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her.\nBy January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.\nThe inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.\nBrooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media.\nPeter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges.\n\"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said.\nBut it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him.\nAn odd fit\nEven if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world.\nStoryful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners.\nThe startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.)\nNews Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company.\nStoryful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility.\nNow, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.\nI feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http://t.co/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015\nWait, what?

Reports from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal say that her position will include work on digital and social media initiatives broadly, with Storyful being one part of that puzzle.\nNews Corp declined to respond to inquires about Brooks and Storyful.\nBrooks comes off to some as an odd fit for the role. As an editor for tabloid newspapers, she has had little experience with digital media or technology.\nJukes noted similarities between Brooks's new position and News Corp's acquisition of MySpace for $580 million. The company later sold the social network for $35 million.\n\"James Murdoch acquired MySpace and it didn't improve. One has to fear for Storyful in that Rebekah Brooks, for all her many talents as a tabloid journalist and editor, has really shown no mastery of social media,\" Jukes said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Your favorite children's book illustrator just got his own exhibition in Chicago\n\nArticle: Despite the fact that renowned author and illustrator Edward Gorey was born in Chicago and spent a sizable chunk of his formative years in the Windy City, his work has never been recognized with its own exhibition. That is, until now.\nBeginning earlier this month and continuing through June 15, the macabre creations of the late Gorey are front and center for two concurrent exhibitions at the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) in Chicago.\nOne of the shows, \"Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey,\" is a touring exhibition organized by the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Penn. that offers a comprehensive look at his illustrations as well as work by other artists he influenced.\nThe second exhibition, \"G is for Gorey, C is for Chicago,\" pulls from the collection of Loyola alumnus Thomas Michalak, a member of the board of directors of the Edward Gorey House in Massachusetts who has collected Gorey material for over two decades. It includes a number of rare items offering a deeper look at the mysterious man behind the art, including some of his report cards, early drawings and book covers he designed, and the ornately decorated envelopes of letters he sent to his mother, Helen.\nPam Ambrose, director of LUMA, told HuffPost the shows aim to address the lack of awareness of Gorey's Chicago roots in addition to tracing the man's development from a budding artist to an acclaimed cultural icon who inspired creators like Daniel Handler and Tim Burton. His influence is also felt in \"Summerland: A Ghost Story,\" a small mixed-media installation by Chicago artist Kenneth Gerleve that's also also included in the show.\n\"I want people to really think about who this man was,\" Ambrose said,\" because he appears to be many contradictions in one persona. But was this a persona invented to keep people away? It's very hard to say. He seems like someone who shapeshifts a bit.\"\nThe LUMA shows have been a hit -- they had people lined up outside the front door on opening day, \"pretty good\" for a university museum, Ambrose noted. Tickets to a Saturday bash celebrating what would have been Gorey's 89th birthday sold quickly.\nWhile Gorey will forever be linked to gothic subculture thanks in large part to his signature Victorian characters dressed in head-to-toe black, the show paints a broader portrait of the artist than that. For example, prominently-placed illustrations of cats throughout the show acknowledge his fascination with felines, and many of his kid-centric illustrations feel downright giddy when compared to his familiar somber style.\n\"This is an artist who was much more important than the immediate perception of just the gothic tale or cautionary tale,\" Ambrose said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Edward Gorey END"}

As the campaign closes its third year, we're thrilled that the latest slew of ads starring Julia Stegner are as refreshing as ever.\nIn case you're not familiar with the concept, the DIY Project lets models take complete control of the shoot, including the styling and actual photography. Rag & Bone simply gives the chosen model a bag of clothes and a digital camera -- the rest is entirely up to her, including whether or not she wears makeup. With Julia Stegner's new shots, the results are fresh, personal and seemingly makeup-free.\nThus far, we've seen gorgeous Rag & Bone styling interpretations by industry powerhouses like Lily Aldridge, Karolina Kurkova, Miranda Kerr, Candice Swanepoel and Carolyn Murphy. As for Stegner, her beachy shoot features her adorable pup and one of the most effortless haircuts we've seen in a while.\nWith more publications swearing off Photoshop (Verily magazine might just be our favorite) and more brands eschewing makeup in ad campaigns, we're happy that a project like this can add to this positive movement in the fashion industry.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Rag & Bone END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The oven cleaning hacks that will have your appliance sparkling without ANY scrubbing\n\nArticle: Scrubbing the oven is one of the most dreaded spring cleaning jobs.\nBut now a new series of kitchen hacks reveals how you can get your appliance sparkling in no time at all - by using just a few simple products you probably already have in your home.\nFrom removing oil by adding more oil to banishing bad smells with lemon and water, these are the very easy - and cheap - tricks that will clean what is often the filthiest part of a kitchen.\n1. CREATE YOUR OWN CLEANER\n'A nifty cleaning cheat for treating stubborn stains is to use a homemade oven cleaner,' advises Rik Hellewell, founder and MD at oven valeting service Ovenu, who put together the tips.\n'This helps save you time and money. A simple mixture of white vinegar and baking soda works wonders to help remove grease and grime.\n'The vinegar will react with the baking soda to foam gently.\n'Rub the paste onto the area you need to treat and leave it for 30 minutes to get to work. Then once the time’s up, you should be able to wipe the dirt away easily.'\n2. CLEAN SHELVES IN 30 MINUTES\n'When was the last time you removed the shelves from your oven?' asks Rik.\n'Probably not that recently. However, in order to cook your food in a hygienic environment, you need to ensure that you keep them sparkling clean.\n'A quick way to restore your shelves to their former glory is to place the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak. Make sure you read the instructions on the cleaning product and wear protective clothing where necessary.\n'After 30 minutes, remove the shelving from the resealable bag. Rinse them under warm water and use a scourer to scrub away any remaining burnt-on food.'\n3. USE AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH\n'An old toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool. Its soft bristles and flexible head allow you to clean areas that would otherwise be out of reach.\n'Even better, if you use an electric toothbrush, the vibration will help to loosen any burnt-on food.\n4. USE A GLASS SCRAPER\n'A glass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains from the door and floor of your oven.\n'If the door is removable, unscrew it and soak in oven cleaner and warm water, then scrape the stuck-on food residue away.'\n5. REMOVE OIL WITH OIL\n'It may sound strange, but you can remove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil.\n'In fact, this technique will make clean-ups in the future really easy. Place a couple of drops of vegetable oil onto a paper towel and rub it over the greasy area.\n'The oil helps to remove the grease without the use of any harsh chemicals. Once clean, spray the areas with all-purpose oven cleaner to ensure that no oil remains.'\n6. BANISH BAD SMELLS EASILY\n'We’ve all cooked a wonderful meal only to have the smell linger for days.\n'If you’ve cooked something especially pungent, like fish, a few drops of vanilla or citrus essence can work wonders.\n'Simply add a few drops in an ovenproof bowl filled with water. Slowly heat the bowl for an hour and you’ll soon rid your kitchen of those pongs.\n7. USE CAR WAX FOR GREASE\n'A dirty hob is a sure sign of a dirty oven. A thin layer of car wax on your hob can help remove built-up grease. Simply apply and wipe away.\n'If any dirt remains, don’t worry. To get a ceramic hob clean, sprinkle with baking soda and a few drops of water. Then wipe clean with a soft cloth. If your oven has steel burners then place them in a resealable bag overnight with a drop of bleach and warm water. The next day, wipe the burners down and wash in warm, soapy water.'\n8. POLISH WITH CREAM OF TARTAR\n'Cream of tartar may seem like an odd cleaning product to use on your oven, but it is extremely effective at keeping stainless steel shiny.\n'Simply apply with a thin cloth, leave for 10 minutes, then wipe away.'\n9. REMOVE STUCK ON FOOD WITH DISHWASHER TABLETS\n'Dishwasher tablets are excellent at removing stuck-on food from your pots and pans in a dishwasher, so why should your oven be any different?\n'Take a dishwasher tablet and dip half of it in warm water. Next rub the tablet over the built-up grease on your oven door and watch the burnt-on dirt wash away with minimal effort.'\n10. HOW TO NEVER SCRUB AGAIN\n'There’s a very quick and easy way to battle grease and grime.\n'Make sure that your oven is completely cool and then spray oven cleaner into the corners. Leave overnight if you can; if not, leave for at least four hours.\n'After the product has worked its magic, you should be able to simply wipe the grime away. If any burnt-on food remains, cover with your homemade cleaning solution of white vinegar and baking soda.' \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " homemade oven cleaner\nplace the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak\nold toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool\nglass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains\nremove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: He Rescued This Bizarre Creature From a Sidewalk, But He Had No Idea What It Would Grow Into\n\nArticle: Jeff Longo was wandering in the intense Florida heat when he saw a tiny ball of fluff on the sidewalk. What’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health.\nThis took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll.\nIndeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg.\nConsequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC.\nHowever, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online.\nFirst, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website’s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for.\nIt turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds.\nThe gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother’s shoes.\nSo, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him – even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream.\nAs each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.\nIndeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of Longo’s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don’t accidentally squish her.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " southern flying squirrel END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: I was really bad at sports in high school. This new study helps me understand why.\n\nArticle: I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive.\nYet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle.\nBy 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).\nFor me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.\nA meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.\nMore precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.\nEven more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.\n\"One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,\" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. \"So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.\"\nBut it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\"\nThe analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.\nPractice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests \"deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,\" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.\nSo what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?\nHere's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.\nBut Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.\n\"There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,\" she says.\nInstead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:\nPersonality and perseverance\nPropensity to get injured\nPropensity to choke under pressure\nIndividual differences in maximum oxygen uptake\nDifferences in how we acquire muscle mass\nCoordination\nHeight\nEnjoyment of competition\n\"We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,\" she says. \"All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.\"\nOverall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular \"10,000 hour rule,\" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.\nOn the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.\n\"Eighteen percent is big,\" Macnamara says. \"We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything.\" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.\nFor the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a \"slow learner\" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.\nGrowing up, my dad was on a quest to find \"my sport\" — the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.\nI'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.\nThese days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some people are just better at sports than others END"}

I was throwing \"I love you\" in to soften the blow, but let’s be honest, when you say it like that, the purpose of the statement is to communicate everything except \"I love you.\" The \"but\" slices the top of the sentence off and the \"I love you\" gets discarded like a strawberry’s calyx. \"I love you,\" usually the most beautiful and powerful triad of words in the world, becomes inauthentic and trivial — cheap. A throwaway line.\nMy husband asked if I could replace the word \"but\" with the word \"and.\" I stopped and repeated the sentence I had just said to him with the revision, and the light bulb inside my head nearly blinded me with epiphany. \"I love you AND you are driving me crazy.\"\nSuddenly, his driving me crazy was no longer an exception to my loving him. It was part and parcel of the package. I could love him and be driven crazy by him simultaneously! A little conjunction transduction made all the difference.\nIt took me a while to make the change in my delivery permanent, but it was worth the effort. It has made a significant difference in my communication with my husband, and now, my kids. Above all else, I want my family to know that I love them regardless of circumstances, even if they are driving me crazy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"but\" END"}

A biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of Damascus and links it to the coming of Armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen.\nA LifeWay Research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, \"I believe the battles in Syria are all part of the prophecies of the Book of Revelation,\" and 32 percent of them said yes.\nTwenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that \"U.S. military intervention in Syria might lead to the Battle of Armageddon that’s spoken about in the Book of Revelation.\"\nGender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between Biblical prophecy and the current situation in Syria.\nLocation and income also skewed the results, with Southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect Syria with the end of days.\nIn addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, \"I believe the world will end in my lifetime.\"\nThe Rev. Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times \"want to know that God is in charge. They want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel,\" according to LifeWay. Though he believes the Bible does predict future events in the Middle East, the author of The End: A Complete Overview of Bible Prophecy and the End of Days said that he \"does not think the trouble in Syria was predicted in the Bible.\"\nIsaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating Syria to the end of the world. It states:\nThe burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. (King James version)\nEd Stetzer, president of LifeWay Research, was surprised by the results of the survey. He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia \"didn't get the same reaction.\" However, Syria's shared border with Israel, as well as the explicit Biblical mention of Damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses.\nStetzer said that he could see why attaching Biblical significance to the Syria conflict would appeal to many Christians, because, \"For Christians, the end of the world doesn’t mean despair.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This Drug Could Add Five Years To Your Dog’s Life\n\nArticle: When examining the benefits of a drug that extends life expectancy, it’s not enough to look at how many years are being added on, but the quality of the years being added. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Dog Aging Project are quick to point that out when they talk about their hopes for rapamycin.\nThe drug, also known as sirolimus, was originally developed and prescribed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs in humans, and also to fight cancer. However, in low doses, rapamycin was shown to slow aging processes and increase the lifespan of mice.\nThe drug is currently being tested on 32 middle-aged dogs (6-9 years old) for its affects on both increase canine longevity and dogs’ overall health. The trial will last up to six months, after which, the dogs will continue to be monitored to hopefully determine an increase in life expectancy. Geneticist Daniel Promislow told The Telegraph:\n\"If rapamycin has a similar effect in dogs – and it’s important to keep in mind we don’t know this yet – then a typical large dog could live two to three years longer, and a smaller dog might live four years longer.\"\nA longer trial is underway to determine how extended treatments with rapamycin affect the longevity in dogs. After the results that have been seen in the mice study, the researchers believe that they could see a dog’s life extended by up to five years by making them more impervious to health issues such as cancer, kidney failure, and dementia.\nNot only would it increase the length of dogs’ overall lives, but it would compound that by increasing their number of \"good\" years. Promislow remains optimistic on both fronts, saying, \"If we can understand how to improve the quality and length of life, it’s good for our pets and good for us. It’s win-win.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " rapamycin END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: ANOTHER Catholic university drops abortion coverage\n\nArticle: A second Catholic university in California this week has dropped elective abortion coverage for its staff.\nIn a letter dated Oct. 3, Santa Clara University President Michael Engh announced the 2014 change to the Jesuit university's 1,600 employees.\n\"Our core commitments as a Catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the University's health plans,\" Engh wrote in the letter.\nThe move appears to be part of a trend among Catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-Catholics, the Los Angeles Times notes. Just this week, Loyola Marymount University, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year.\nThe move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made.\n\"The policy comes as quite a shock,\" Nancy Unger, a history professor at Santa Clara, said to NBC. \"There was no discussion. There was a request for discussion afterwards, which many of us felt was really sort of patronizing.\"\nPresident Obama's Affordable Care Act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage.\nHealth plans must cover birth control under the Affordable Care Act, but Obamacare allows employers to offer plans that restrict abortion coverage.\nFather Jim Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, sympathized with Santa Clara's decision.\n\"An elective abortion is a serious moral evil, and if it’s in our power to end that on whatever level we can operate, we should do our best to end that moral evil,\" Bretzke said to CBS. \"They believe that that is a moral evil and so they’re pursuing dropping that from their packages.\"\nThe change by the universities moves in the opposite direction of California's abortion law.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: College president to students: \"This is not a day care. This is a university!\"\n\nArticle: This fall, protests at Yale, Princeton, Duke and the University of Missouri — where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil — drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus.\nThe protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable.\nEverett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, weighed in with a letter to the campus community:\nThis past week, I actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt \"victimized\" by a sermon on the topic of 1 Corinthians 13. It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable.\nI’m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\"\nI have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty! The goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins — not coddle you in your selfishness. The primary objective of the Church and the Christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization!\nSo here’s my advice:\nIf you want the chaplain to tell you you’re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you’re looking for. If you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place.\nIf you’re more interested in playing the \"hater\" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don’t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in Missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but Oklahoma Wesleyan isn’t one of them.\nAt OKWU, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. We are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. We want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. We believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. We don’t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don’t issue \"trigger warnings\" before altar calls.\nOklahoma Wesleyan is not a \"safe place\", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn’t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that’s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that’s wrong with them. This is a place where you will quickly learn that you need to grow up!\nThis is not a day care. This is a university!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Oklahoma Wesleyan University END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: She might be the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette war thanks to Stephen Colbert\n\nArticle: \"I felt kind of icky to be benefiting from this fight,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"At the same time, the opportunity to reach readers is a fantasy.\"\n\"I did still wonder whether anyone would care,\" she added.\nOh, they care. \"California,\" which arrives on Tuesday, is now one of the most preordered debut titles in Hachette history, according to a company spokeswoman. Ms. Lepucki’s agent is negotiating rights with the producer Gregg Fienberg and Killer Films. Little, Brown and Company, the Hachette division behind \"California,\" has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour.\nMs. Lepucki found herself in Portland, Ore., this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore Powell’s Books, where \"California\" hit No. 1 on the best-seller list after Mr. Colbert directed viewers there.\n\"Occasionally, my brain would overheat, and I’d forget how to write,\" she said of her signing session. \"My signature is like a squished spider.\"\nHow Ms. Lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck. And it has a twist: Her husband, Patrick Brown, is employed, in a sense, by Amazon. He works for Goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; Amazon acquired it last year.\n\"Amazon has historically been a bully, and I don’t shop there,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"But I love Goodreads. For the record. And my marriage.\"\nMr. Colbert’s promotion of \"California\" started with Sherman Alexie, an anti-Amazonian and National Book Award winner for \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\" Mr. Colbert invited Mr. Alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by Amazon’s refusal to take Hachette preorders. Mr. Alexie said that he asked Hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse.\n\"California\" was on the top of the stack. \"I honestly suspected it wasn’t going to be my kind of book — too earnest,\" Mr. Alexie said in a telephone interview. \"But I started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner.\"\nWith its post-apocalyptic setting, \"California\" mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction. But Ms. Lepucki sees it as a love story. A young couple, Frida and Cal, have fled the ruins of Los Angeles to make a home in the wilderness. Everything changes when Frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats.\nIt seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, where she grew up, the freckled Ms. Lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke. Still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously.\n\"I have a darker imagination than most people,\" she said. \"If you don’t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, I don’t think you’re really human.\"\nMs. Lepucki winced when asked if the couple in \"California\" is modeled on her and her husband. It’s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, Dixon Bean, while writing.\nBut no. \"I’m madly in love with my husband, but it’s not us,\" she said. \"People seem to hate Frida, so I hope I’m not her.\" (Her mother-in-law’s response to the book: \"I’m sad she killed me in a blizzard.\")\nMs. Lepucki is a graduate of Oberlin College and the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and is the founder and director of Writing Workshops Los Angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008. She is also known in book circles as a writer for The Millions, a highbrow literary website.\n\"California\" is actually her second novel. But the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, Erin Hosier, called \"the novel equivalent of a Harmony Korine movie,\" failed to sell to a publisher. \"It was overly ambitious,\" Ms. Hosier said. \"We finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful.\"\nThat put more pressure on \"California.\" \"You really can’t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials,\" Ms. Hosier said.\nEven before the boost from Mr. Colbert, \"California\" was receiving praise from respected novelists like Jennifer Egan and Ben Fountain and popping up on summer reading lists. Little, Brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers.\nBut insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed. She had another confession to make, too: Yes, she shuns Amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of Bag Balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders. \"I had a chapped elbow,\" she explained.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Edan Lepucki END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Lawmakers are going to punish university for not shutting down \"Sex Week\"\n\nArticle: A group of conservative Tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the state's flagship public university over a student-organized event in early March called \"Sex Week\" -- by dramatically cutting back its ability to host guest speakers.\nState lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the University of Tennessee (UT) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to \"engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events.\" Even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.)\nAnother bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker.\nBoth of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics.\nCampfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013.\nLast week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week.\nGov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law.\nUniversity leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block Sex Week because the First Amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. Bell and Gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. But UT system President Joe DiPietro told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that the university did not have \"any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program.\"\nAttendance at Sex Week increased this year, according to the school's Daily Beacon. Sex Week organizers told HuffPost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an UT administrator said in February that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni.\nNonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\"\nOn Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday.\nA UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said:\nWhile I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized.\nUT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard.\n\"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " University of Tennessee END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Explainer: Is There Any Science Behind Astrology?\n\nArticle: Photo credit: pixabay.com\nLooking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint.\nA hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient.\nUnsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.\nDiego Andrés Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, \"Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.\"\nSEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet\n\"And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!\"\nSo, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology?\nThere are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley’s Understanding Science website lays out a \"Science checklist.\"\n1. Does astrology use testable ideas?\nFor something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.\"\n2. Does it rely on evidence?\nThere haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.\nSo far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.\n3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?\nYes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.\nHowever, as Understanding Science explains, \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.\"\nPlus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.\nSo, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. Until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience.\nYou should read this next: Science Explainer: Why GMOs Aren’t Harmful to Your Health\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.\" END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Shower Habits You Need To Stop Doing Immediately\n\nArticle: Did you know theres actually a right way to shower? Get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. Here are the things you need to stop doing while showering.\nShowering is—and should be—a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. Some people can’t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there.\nHowever, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? Believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you’ve never thought of.\nCheck out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good.\n1. Washing Your Face\nWithout a doubt, it’s easier and less messy to wash your face when you’re already in the shower. However, despite the convenience, it’s actually not good for your face. The water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you’d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly.\nThose with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation—it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea.\n2. Not Washing Your Feet\nYou might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you’re in the shower, so there’s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. You’d be wrong, though.\nEven if you’re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. Not only that, but if you’re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way.\nThere’s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore—imagine what you’re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash.\n3. Not Washing or Replacing Your Loofah Regularly\nBe honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? Months? YEARS? As it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. This video demonstrates why:\nConsider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you’re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying.\n4. Using a Soap Dish\nYes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn’t that good of an idea. The majority of people don’t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it—bacteria that you’re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up.\nIf you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you’re out of the shower.\n5. Using Scented Soaps\nYes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time.\nAnyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it’s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. Plus, you won’t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create \"questionable\" smells.\n6. Showering in Hard Water\nSome people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage.\nHard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. Those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker.\nIf you’re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals.\n7. Avoiding Cold Showers\nMost people wouldn’t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that’s anything less than steaming hot.\nStill, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. A quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate.\nIn addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time.\n8. Using Old Razors\nFor most of us, old razors aren’t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. Instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. Razors, whether you’re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive—so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work?\nWell, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn’t mean it’s doing so effectively. If you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it’s because the blades are dull and it’s time for a replacement.\n9. Leaving Your Razor in the Shower\nRemember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? The same thing goes for your razor. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment.\nIf you don’t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you’re done using it so it can air dry.\n10. Over Exfoliating\nGiving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. For anyone who doesn’t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so.\nAnyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result. It’s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that, you know, there’s actually something there worth exfoliating.'\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum\nMost of the world didn't know anyone lived in the highlands of Papua New Guinea until the 1930s, when Australian gold prospectors surveying the area realized there were about a million people there.\nWhen researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. Among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the Fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. They called the disease kuru , which means \"shivering\" or \"trembling.\"\nOnce symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the \"laughing death.\" Within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions.\nMany locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. The disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. In some villages, there were almost no young women left.\n\"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says Shirley Lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the City University of New York.\nBut what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. So in 1961, Lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue.\nBut Lindenbaum, who continues to But Lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades.\nLindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals.\nIn many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief.\nAs one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\"\nWomen removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body.\n\"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body — taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum.\nBut women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\"\nFinally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\"\nBut it wasn't a virus — or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive.\nAs As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge.\nThe process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations — a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\"\nThe epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic — the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in a million people in the U.S. develop CJDthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue.\nThough the Fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects.\nAccording to According to Michael Alpers , a medical researcher at Curtin University in Australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. His team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. \"I have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru,\" he wrote in an email.\nEnlarge this image When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum\nBut while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades.

People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease . Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species.\nBut, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases.\nFor one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place — the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.

One leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalNature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.\nBut here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\"\nKuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now.\n\" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Are lefties really more creative?\n\nArticle: The left-handed brand has come a long way in the last few decades. The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today’s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative?\nThe answer to that is a definitive ... maybe.\nScientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They’ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They’ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they’re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated.\nA handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all.\nSome researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.\nBut \"Are lefties different?\" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it’s not which hand is dominant that matters—it’s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it’s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks.\nThese experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people’s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we’ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left.\nBut who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What It Feels Like to Die\n\nArticle: \"Do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?\" My mother and I sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents’ Colorado home. It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she’d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor’s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren’t prepared for the nurse’s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics—not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died.\nThere’s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the ‘event horizon,’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control’s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there’s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\"\nWhether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there’s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes—and the medicine usually works. \"If they’re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that’s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn’t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it’s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you’re not really responsive, that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what’s happening.\"\n* * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills—and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that’s where people begin to see light.\"\nRecent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain’s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘realer than real.’\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you’re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you’re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you’re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.\"\n* * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother’s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she’d been doing. \"Putting things away,\" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people’s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients’ pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. The researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death. \"The predominant quality of pre-death dreams/visions was a sense of personal meaning, which frequently carried emotional significance for the patient,\" they report.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing\nPre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\nFirst hunger and then thirst are lost.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This company wants you to bring your dog to work\n\nArticle: When we visited Nvidia (NVDA) earlier this month to research the Yahoo Finance Company of the Year, we noticed something unusual roaming the hallways: canines.\nNvidia, it turns out, allows and even encourages its workers to bring their dogs to work. \"Dogs, as we know, get lonely,\" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang tells Yahoo Finance. \"If you want to be a responsible dog parent, one way to do that is to provide them company. I see it from the perspective of the dog. It’s the right thing to do.\"\nNvidia’s puppy love began informally several years ago, when one worker asked Huang if he could bring his dog to work. Sure, the CEO said: \"I used to have a dog myself. I’d go home from work to see the dog during lunch.\"\nMore dog owners started bringing their pets, and the company adopted a formal policy. Dogs have to be leashed while on campus, and attended by their owner. They aren’t allowed near food areas, for sanitary reasons. If a meeting is on the schedule, the owner has to get a co-worker to keep an eye on the dog. In some cases, dog owners have been relocated to accommodate a neighbor with an allergy or other aversion to dogs.\nSince the Silicon Valley tech company occupies a sprawling, low-rise campus, there’s plenty of outdoor space for letting the dogs out, as evident in the video above. The company provides poop bags, but no staff to handle the chore; owners must clean up after their own dogs.\nAs our cameras rolled, several dogs frolicked in the grass, each seemingly comfortable with the others. Dog feuds are rare, Nvidia employees told us. Most dogs adjust quickly to the new digs once they start coming to work, and owners bring beds or blankets to cozy up on the floors of their cubicles, where dogs loll much of the day. Naps are often interrupted by co-workers or visitors who want to play.\nA few other companies allow dogs, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce (CRM), hotel chain Kimpton and candy company Mars. (About 7% of US employers allow pets in the workplace, according to the Society of Human Resource Management.) The perk saves owners the expense of paying for a dog walker at home. Some managers say pets promote collegiality in the office, and even help reduce employee stress. Nervous about your deadline? Here, pet this.\nCats, alas, are not welcome at Nvidia, or any other company we’re aware of, because they’re less comfortable in unfamiliar places—and they occasionally provoke the dogs. Besides, the cat probably enjoys the solitude when the dog—and its owner—go to work.\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: If Donald Trump were black, would the GOP base accept him? The answer is obvious.\n\nArticle: Last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host — let’s call him Donell Trump — announced his candidacy for president of the United States. A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, \"fat,\" \"ugly\" and \"pigs\"; he told one female journalist she had \"the face of a dog.\"\nOnce the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, Donell Trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. He joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. If Donell Trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told Esquire in 1991: \"It really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"\nThen there’s money. Donell Trump can’t get enough of it. He’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star. A substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but Donell Trump has no apologies.\nDonell Trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. He routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on Manhattan’s 5th Avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent.\nPresented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? Would Bill O’Reilly and Jerry Falwell Jr. praise Donell Trump as a model American businessman and moral leader? Or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and \"baby daddy\" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of African American absentee fatherhood? Would Rush Limbaugh insist that Donell Trump’s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? Or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of Ebonics?\n\" A racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. f t\nIn a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated President Obama. An intellectual, Ivy League-educated, cool-tempered family man, Obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-Christ, a crypto-Muslim Manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy America. Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme.\nGranted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong. The values Donell Trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president.\nMy point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a \"thug.\"\nSome conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public.\nMoreover, so much of Donald Trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump’s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.\nWhich brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society. Yet it’s far from hidden; it courses through the presidential campaign, as the notion of a Donell Trump candidacy clearly shows.\nJames Kirchick is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Initiative. His book \"The End of Europe\" is forthcoming from Yale University Press.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis’ crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy’s or Disclosure’s.The frontman doesn’t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it’s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: \"All these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare/ Shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there.\" Um, thanks for that, Anthony.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer is a 54 year-old man who’s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band’s resident badass. There’s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe.\nIt’s a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. At times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with Flea’s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they’re having more fun, him or the crowd. Guess what the answer is.Of the many, many former members of RHCP, you could argue that ex-guitarist John Frusciante was – even more so than founding member Hillel Slovak – the only irreplaceable one. Yet Josh Klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling Frusciante’s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. Frusciante is still missed – Keidis recently said of him that, \"Never did I meet someone who was so easy to write songs with\" – but Klinghoffer is making the role his own.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven’t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. Even so, it’s fair to say that songs like ‘Dark Necessities’ and ’Go Robot’ - both taken from the band’s new album, ‘The Getaway’ - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight.\nSay what you will about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as ‘Under The Bridge’ don’t deserve the scorn of Fox News. You might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed – unlike, say, set-closer ‘Give It Away’.\nLook, it’s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. This is a universe, after all, in which Nickelback, Limp Bizkit and The Pigeon Detectives all exist on the same planet. And even if you truly can’t stand the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you’d still have a hard time arguing they were even the worst band on this stage – not when Imagine Dragons were the most recent occupants of it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " you’d still have a hard time arguing they were even the worst band on this stage END"}

Besides their crappy sound, they’re basically designed to break. And yet they sell millions of pairs of headphones. It’s practically a perfect business: Take crap and sell it for a fortune. How do they do it? In part it’s marketing, and you know, Dr. Dre. But there’s more.\nA detailed teardown (via PopMech) of a pair of Beats’ immensely popular Solo headphones conducted by hardware-focused venture capital firm Bolt has some answers buried beneath. The headphones are incredibly cheaply made. The company cuts corners everywhere it can; gluing pieces together instead of using screws, and reducing the amount of tooling wherever possible. Amazingly, for all the company’s claims about precision sound design, the headphones use freaking off-the-shelf drivers!\nNone of this is all that surprising because Beats are, after all, terrible and fragile. The crazy part is that the headphones are so cheap that Beats actually needs to add weight to make them feel heftier. From the Medium post:\nOne of the great things about the solo headphones is how substantial they feel. A little bit of weight makes the product feel solid, durable, and valuable. One way to do this cheaply is to make some components out of metal in order to add weight. In these headphones, 30% of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight.\nHere is an image illustrating this point:\nOn the left, all of the components that actually do something.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This might be the darkest theory yet about why Donald Trump keeps winning\n\nArticle: On television and on the stump, at debates and in speeches, Donald Trump is reminding the American people that they are going to die.\nThe reminders aren’t explicit, and they probably aren’t part of an intentional strategy. All the same, much of Trump’s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers’ omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to Sheldon Solomon, a psychologist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\nThat includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. Study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for Trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally.\n\"I’m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring,\" Solomon said.\nSolomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book \" Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book \" The Denial of Death ,\" but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor.\n\"It was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof,\" Solomon said. He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation.\nTheir research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven’t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death.\nFor example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death.\nSolomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.\nThen the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. Shown \"C O F F _ _,\" for example, many people might write \"COFFEE,\" especially students in college. If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead.\nThe participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.\nAssigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.\nSolomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.\nYet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence.

The pattern extends to religious beliefs. Another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the Bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist Christians.\nFor Solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or \"staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some Cheez Whiz on a cracker,\" in Solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Ex-Cons Remember Their Worst Jobs After Being Released from Prison\n\nArticle: Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through \"work-release.\" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.\nThat said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between.\nAfter serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison.\nImage of cattle ranchers via Wikimedia Creative Commons\nMendoor Smith, 43-Year-Old from Iowa\nServed 12 Years for Marijuana Possession\nReleased from Custody in 2013\nThe worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens.\nI remember calving one shift during the winter, and when I did my hourly inspection of the herd, I noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. Having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating.\nI had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise.\nDavid Hibdon, 55-Year-Old from Missouri\nServed 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy\nReleased from Custody in 2014\nMy first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car.\nI worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after.\nI've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. I eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. I could go back to the dump if I wanted, but that job sucked.\nImage of a telemarketing call center via\nMike Vargas, 44-Year-Old from Washington DC\nServed 14 Years for a Drug Conspiracy\nReleased from Custody in 2009\nIt wasn't hard getting a job when I came home, it just wasn't a good job. I started working the same week I was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. You had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. It was cool at first, but after a while I was starting to feel like a robot.\nI worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. Anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. You had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. If you went to get a Coke, you had to clock out. If you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. If you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. There was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course.\nDudes would curse out the boss. One dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. He walked out shortly after. But most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. I quit that job when I had something better lined up. It served its purpose because if you don't have a gig you have to stay at the halfway. I've had like seven or eight jobs since then. I've done a lot of different things, but that was the worst. I'm a machinist now, and I assemble parts all day at a machine. It's easier and the pay is better, but I am always looking for something better.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer,\npicking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather\ntelemarketing place END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Verizon and AT&amp;T Don't Like This Internet Ruling, But Your Pocketbook Will\n\nArticle: Verizon and AT&T Don't Like This Internet Ruling, But Your Pocketbook Will\nA seemingly obscure legal decision was reached this week, but it affects our use and enjoyment of the Internet, and ensures that we won't be charged more for it. The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality.\nNet neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It’s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It’s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined.\nBut for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay.\nIt was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay.\nThree years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO’s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes.\nOpposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix. The Internet Association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. They want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access.\nNext Page: How the citizens beat the lobbyists, and what this decision means for you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " net neutrality END"}

Not much has been revealed about the next film in the historic franchise, but it seems a leak of the potential title has given us plenty of cause for speculation. In a video that seems to show some kind of Star Wars celebration, an apparent poster depicts Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.\nEpisode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.\nIf this is truly the title, we will definitely be in for an interesting storyline. However, I don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set.\nIndeed, Star Wars has a long history of doing this. Check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years.\nStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace\nAhh, Episode I, how hyped you were. But that is beside the point. While the title The Phantom Menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. The original was Episode I: The Beginning. Pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. Personally, I liked this title much more than The Phantom Menace and I think they should have stuck with it.\nStar Wars: Episode II – Attack Of The Clones\nThis is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. Episode II – Attack of the Clones brought us the lovable Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in Jar Jar Binks. And this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for Episode II was Episode II: Jar Jar's Big/Great Adventure. Could you imagine if Lucasfilm actually ran with this? The backlash would have been insurmountable and I don't think it would have every recovered from that. #HailJarJar!\nStar Wars: Episode VI – Return Of The Jedi\nHighly regarded as one of the best films of all time, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi is a pop culture classic. It was so popular that Family Guy titled the first part of its Star Wars trilogy after Episode VI's working title. Of course, I am referring to the infamous Blue Harvest, which was the name that was used during production of Return of the Jedi — and a name that will always be etched in the minds of Star Wars fanatics everywhere.\nStar Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens\nThe Force Awakens was easily one of the most anticipated films of ALL TIME. Unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. It was titled after J.J. Abrams' production company and was referred to as Episode VII: Foodles. A bit adolescent I know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless.\nStar Wars: Episode VII – Fall Of The Resistance (Possibly)\nThe apparent leaked title of the next installment is Fall of the Resistance. Whether this is the actual title or a working title is a mystery in itself, but Episode VIII already has a working title, according to Carrie Fisher — Space Bear: Episode VIII. No, this is not a joke. Fisher tweeted out a photo of her adorable dog sitting on a chair with this supposed headline.\nPretty adorable, and the whole crew seems to really be having a great time working on Episode VIII. #SpaceBear2017!\nSo What Is Your Favorite Star Wars Working Title?\nWith each Star Wars temporary name, there are some funny ones and definitely some weird ones. Each one is unique and shows just how fascinating it must be to be a part of the on-set moviemaking magic.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Fall of the Resistance. END"}

Per The Independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. It will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents.\nBut \"decriminalized\" is not the same as \"legal,\" as a Swiss Broadcasting Corporation report makes clear. Growing marijuana plants, imbibing the drug in any form and dealing it are still forbidden.\nPenalties are now stricter for anyone caught selling to a person under the age of 18. The new law also provides greater resources to help children with marijuana habits. A 2013 UNICEF report found Swiss children are the world's second-most likely to smoke marijuana, with just over 24 percent of 11, 13 and 15-year-olds having smoked pot in the last year.\nFor perspective, Canada leads the world in kids' marijuana use, with 28 percent of its children aged 11, 13, and 15 admitting to smoking pot in the past 12 months.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Switzerland END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The iPhone 5C number Apple doesn't want you to know\n\nArticle: On Monday, Apple managed to make a bit of news by not announcing any. For the first time, the iPhone maker didn't reveal how many preorders were made on its new line of smartphones. The silence on orders for the iPhone 5C -- a week after it was announced -- has investors down on the tech giant.\nSince 2010, Apple's media blitz for its new iPhone has gone like this: On a Friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, The Verge points out. A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. By the time the iPhone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million.\nBy creating the perception of scarcity, Apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iPhone. But this year, Apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iPhone 5C preorders went live. This didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. With investors interpreting Apple's silence as weak initial 5C sales, Apple's stock slid to $450 on Monday from Friday's close of $465.\nBut circumstances may be a bit different this year. For one, Apple's top-line phone, the iPhone 5S, can't be preordered. If you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for Apple. The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales. As many others have pointed out, the iPhone 5C is essentially a rebranded iPhone 5 with nearly all the same specs. John Gruber, a well-regarded Apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for Apple's second-tier phone:\nIt’s just that instead of putting the year-old iPhone 5 in slot #2, they’ve created the 5C to debut in that slot. The 5C is, effectively, an iPhone 5. Same A6, same camera, same just about everything — except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... What changes with the 5C is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that Apple can promote apart from the flagship 5S.\nWith Android-run smartphones made by Samsung and Google cutting into Apple's market share, many see the global appetite for Apple smartphones waning. But preorder numbers for iPhone 5C, even if they are low, may not be the best indication.\nFor now, Apple will keep plugging away at the 5C.

Rick Snyder (R-Michigan) will shut down a secret fund that paid salaries to his trusted advisors, living expenses for Detroit's emergency manager, and new furniture and security for the Governor's residences, one of his spokepersons confirmed to The Huffington Post.\nThe \"NERD\" fund, an acronym for \"New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify Fund,\" is a nonprofit, but all the donors' names have been kept anonymous from the public. Gov. Snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities.\n\"There’s an independent board that does that work,\" Snyder said under oath, according to the Detroit News.\nIn 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $1.3 million. But there's been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 IRS return obtained by the Detroit Free Press.\nSara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, told The Huffington Post that the fund had \"had simply become an unnecessary distraction.\" But she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and \"all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely.\"\nShe confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations \"will go far above and beyond what the law requires\" -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details. She also defended Snyder's need for the fund to subsidize additional government expenses.\n\"The function and purposed of the fund is essential to continued reinvention efforts, saving taxpayer dollars, and helping ensure responsive, accessible government,\" Wurfel said.\nSnyder still has a solid lead over gubernatorial opponent Mark Schauer in the 2014 election, according to a recent poll published by MIRS. But the fund has become one of the biggest controversies in the Michigan governor's tenure.\nMany wonder whether donors or special interest groups contributed to the fund in secret have received any favoritism from the governor's office. NERD is \"fundamentally involved in remaking the form and purposes of state government, and the interests who benefit from that financially would certainly have an interest in supporting it financially,\" Rich Robinson, head of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, told the Detroit Free Press.\n\"Shutting down this slush fund in an attempt to avoid transparency only raises more red flags,\" said Michigan State AFL-CIO President Karla Swift in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.\n\"Republican Gov. Snyder should keep his promises of transparency and immediately disclose which corporate special interests are backing the NERD Fund,\" Lon Johnson, Michigan Democratic Party Chair, added in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.\nThere's still no word on whether Gov. Snyder will make the names of donors to the NERD Fund public. A new website, SecretiveSnyder.com, asks, \"When will Snyder come clean?\"\nHow was the NERD Fund money spent?\nPaying for the upscale condo rented at the Westin Book Cadillac by Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, as well as other expenses of Orr's. The condo is rented at a price of $4,200 per month; the fund also paid for travel expenses for Orr to see his family, which resides in Maryland. Wurfel told the Detroit Free Press that one of the fund's stated purposes is to offset the cost of governance. Orr's salary is $275,000. \"Given the financial straits of the city, the limited resources of the state, and the very big and challenging job that Kevyn was hired to do, it was deemed appropriate and necessary to help save taxpayer dollars,\" Wurfel said.\n$130,638 spent on a security system and new furniture for the state-owned residences used by Gov. Snyder, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n$100,000 in consulting fees to MI Partners LLC. Gov. Snyder was the sole client of the consulting firm run by Rich Baird, who Gov. Snyder calls his \"transformation manager,\" according to the Detroit News. Baird, a Snyder adviser who was the architect of the governor's successful campaign team, retired as a global partner from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Baird was appointed a state employee on Wednesday, according to the Detroit News.

He was paid $48,366 for 10 hours of weekly work as Assistant Secretary and Treasurer of the NERD fund (the 501 (c)4's only paid employee of 2011.) At the same time, he was also collecting a salary from Gov. Snyder's campaign committee, according to Citizensforethics.org.

Work visas rose from 2,296 to 2,699 over the same period.\n\"What we are experiencing at the moment is a slight increase in visas issued to American nationals, both temporary work visas and permanent resident visas,\" Steve McGill, general manager at Immigration New Zealand, told the BBC.\n\"We have had a pretty active strategy of identifying investors out of America over the past few years.\n\"It's a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means New Zealand is a pretty attractive place,\" Mr McGill said.\nThe revelation that Mr Thiel had quietly become a New Zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment.\nBut Mr McGill said opposition to wealthy investors, who can secure a residency visa by spending a minimum amount in the country, was not a major issue.\n\"I am aware of the recent commentary around Mr Thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in. What we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities.\n\"We are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors,\" he said.\nBetter lifestyle\nIt isn't just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to New Zealand.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What's lurking in your white wine WILL scare you\n\nArticle: White wine, beer and Brussels sprouts can be major sources of the toxic metal arsenic in people's diets, according to a new study.\nResearchers analyzed the diets of 852 people in New Hampshire, and the levels of arsenic in their toenails, which show long-term exposure to the chemical.\nOf the 120 foods the researchers looked at, four turned out to significantly raise people's arsenic levels: beer, white wine (and to a lesser extent, red wine), Brussels sprouts and dark-meat fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines, according to the study, published last week (Nov. 16) in the Nutrition Journal.\nThe most significant source of arsenic in most people's diets is drinking water. The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods.\nThe results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said.\nThe element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. [5 Things You Should Know About Arsenic]\nIn the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the EPA limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits.\nThe arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\nThe toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said.\nPeople who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink.\nThe study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]\nOne possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said.\nAnd lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic.\n\"The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,\" Cottingham said.\nThe researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels.\nPeople who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month.\nAlthough some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. \"Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.\"\nIt's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. \"If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. Water is something we are drinking and using every day,\" Cottingham said. \"So knowing what your water exposure is, I think, is a big piece of the puzzle.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " toxic metal arsenic END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen\n\nArticle: oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. Problem is, he won’t carry his EpiPen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket.\n\"It’s large and it’s impractical,\" Clark said. \"Where’s he going to put it?\"\nThis underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great.\nThey’re reliable, sure. They’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital.\nBut they’re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they’re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs.\nThe devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is \"investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.\"\nBut critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: \"If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,\" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law.\n\"EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug,\" Price said.\nCompetitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product. But it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap.\nHere’s why:\n1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025\nEpinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s.\nBut Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust.\nThe company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack.\nThe very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.)\n\"If you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment,\" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. \"You just have to know how to use it.\"\nAllen’s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on Mylan’s patent.\n\"It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,\" Allen said. \"It’s not rocket science. It’s purely the patent that stops us.\"\n2. There’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis\nChris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years.\nWindgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated.\nBut that’s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market.\nThough EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said.\n\"It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\"\nOne EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it’s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved.\n3. It doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps\nIn the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine.\n\"We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,\" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said.\nMannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations.\nThe same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis.\n4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive\nA lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product.\n\"The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,\" Baum said. \"But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.\"\nPublic anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it.\n\"We’re just focused on being that competition,\" he said.\n5. The public hasn’t spoken (loud enough)\nDenise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy.\nBut though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines.\n\"It’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I’ve looked at it closely — until I had to start paying all this money,\" Clark said.\nGranted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025\n2.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here's what Donald Trump rejects when he undermines the election results\n\nArticle: In what immediately became the headline moment at the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday night, Republican candidate Donald Trump sparked widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation \"in suspense\" about whether he will accept the results of the election next month.\n\"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner,\" said moderator Chris Wallace. \"Not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.\"\nIndeed, the nation's ability to regularly and peacefully replace the President was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the American experiment. As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\"\nBut while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test.\nAfter all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals—the incumbent Adams as well as Burr—accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal:\n[It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.\nThis principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise.\nFor example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why:\nAs all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support.\nThat tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required:\nAlmost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.\nThat doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes.\nSouth Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome. The rest of the Confederacy would soon follow South Carolina's lead. By April, the Civil War had begun.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " he would keep the nation \"in suspense\" about whether he will accept the results END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out In 2016\n\nArticle: The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains\nThe LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift.\nWe are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn’t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community.\nWe should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn’t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media!\n15 Kristen Stewart\nActress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said \"Make America Gay Again.\" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump.\n14 Aubrey Plaza\nWho didn’t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy’s (Chris Pratt’s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress’ unique and distinguishable character traits aren’t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender \"isn’t a factor\" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don’t identify as either. Plaza’s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very \"androgynous and masculine\" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love \"with girls and guys,\" and that she can’t help it.\n13 Mara Wilson\nSometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote \"F*cking hell, Orlando.\" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: \"I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself.\" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one’s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual.\n12 Colton Haynes\nActor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes’ \"secret gay past,\" and that it got them \"so excited.\" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing \"Was it a secret? Let’s all just enjoy life & have no regrets.\" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes’ way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn’t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy!\n11 Reid Ewing\nIf the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that’s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: \"Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af.\" Someone commented and asked \"Did you just out yourself?\" to which Ewing replied \"I was never in.\" *Drops mic* That’s the way to do it!\n10 Shane Dawson\nFor years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people’s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled \"I’m Bisexual.\" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn’t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they’re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, \"I don’t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,\" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual.\n9 Ryan Beatty\nAnother celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that’s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words \"raging homosexual\" and \"gay power.\" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is \"comfortable enough to say it\" and \"can finally breathe.\" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: \"i’m so happy i’m gay\" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, \"Passion.\"\n8 Rayvon Owen\nSome of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol’s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song \"Can’t Fight It\" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In \"Can’t Fight It,\" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something’s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man’s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15 Kristen Stewart\n14 Aubrey Plaza\n13 Mara Wilson\n12 Colton Haynes\n11 Reid Ewing END"}

Working and spending each day with your partner can be challenging at the best of times, but we never predicted that Kit Harington's girlfriend would have such thoughts. Despite bagging one of the most sought-after hunks on the small screen, Rose Leslie has pledged to never work with her love again.\nThe 29-year-old redhead had the pleasure of acting as Ygritte alongside her scraggly-haired beau – who has captured the hearts of many a teenage fangirl – during her stint in hit television series, Game Of Thrones. Whilst the majority of human kind would be more than happy to spend every living hour with Harington, she's decided she has better things to do.\nAs much as she loves her boyfriend, Leslie wants to achieve her own success away from the gossip-mongers who feed off her high-profile relationship, which means working on individual projects and carving out a career on her own accord.\nLeslie told the Evening Standard: \"I think we leave it at that. We had such a fabulous time working together on Thrones.\n\"I think it's important to do your own projects that mean a lot to you individually, rather than be associated with someone else. I'm a big believer in doing your own thing,\" she added.\nIt's not as if the lovebirds really had the choice of working together on GoTagain, as both of their on-screen alter egos were killed off. Ygritte kicked the bucket after being shot by a child with a bow and arrow, and died in Jon Snow's (Harington) arms, whilst poor Snowy was left for dead after being stabbed multiple times. Grim viewing, to say the least. It was during her 17 episodes on the show that she became Snow's love interest, both on and off screen.\nInsisting she wouldn't like to see her character brought back from the dead, she continued: \"I'm now a little pile of ash. The writers are being incredibly loyal to the books and the way it's developed Jon Snow needs to be on his own and take charge of his own life. I think it's a good thing that she died.\"\nAnd it looks as though Harington kept the fate of Jon Snow under wraps with his beloved, divulging that she was unaware he'd return to the show following his shock death at the end of series five.\nThough \"ecstatic\" about his reappearance, she claimed she is \"going to have words\" with him for being so shady about the new season six. She said: \"I had no idea...I was kind of like, just as surprised as the rest of the world when the man woke back up again.\"\nWatch Game Of Thrones on Sky Atlantic on Monday (16 May) at 9pm.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " wants to achieve her own success END"}

They are only 142 Pokémon available in the US, nine short of the 151 featured in the original television series.\nThree of the nine (Mr. Mime, Kangaskhan and Farfetch’d) are only available outside the US. The other six (Ditto, Moltres, Articuno, Zapdos, Mew and Mewtwo) have not been located at all, which begs two questions:\nAre they even available? If so, where are they?\nThe first question is the easiest to answer — yes, the missing six are out there somewhere.\nHow do we know? Well, people have searched through the coding of the actual game and found the six Pokémon in question are embedded in the game’s data.\nHere’s a video illustrating that point.\nThe second question is a bit trickier; where Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Ditto and Mewtwo are is anyone’s guess. But there’s very tangible evidence indicating the answer to where Mew may be, and all it requires is a Millennial trip down Memory Lane.\nThe first Pokémon games our generation truly fell in love with were the Red and Blue versions for the Game Boy. In those games, upon reaching Cinnabar Island, players have to navigate their ways through the Pokémon Mansion, a burned mansion where a Pokémon researcher used to live.\nThere’s a specific journal in Pokémon Mansion that a player can read. In that journal lies the entry detailing the origins of a mysterious Pokémon.\nPokemon Red\nThe records clearly state the mysterious Pokémon was named Mew.\nPokemon Red\nPokémon Go is no stranger to placing Pokémon in specific habitats. You’re much more likely to catch a Magikarp or a Goldeen near the Hudson River, for instance, than you are to catch them in your bedroom.\nAnd the game has already shown it can go to great lengths to place a Pokémon exclusively where it \"belongs.\" For example. there’s no doubt Kangaskhan is available in Australia because of its Kangaroo-like features.\nThe idea that Mew is somewhere in a jungle in Guyana not only falls in line with its history but also current patterns in the game.\nThat being said, we have every reason to believe you can find Mew in Pokémon Go — that is if you’re in Guyana.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Guyana END"}

Kisha Bari’s images feel instantly iconic, and will undoubtedly be added to the catalog of feminist history for being one of the few photographers to cover the making of such a large-scale protest.\n—Kate Bubacz, senior photo editor, BuzzFeed News\n2. \"Honest Photos of Motherhood Challenge What We Think of as Natural\" — Huffington Post\nIn Leah DeVun’s exploration of motherhood, she focused on apparatuses that aid women in performing the very maternal act of nursing their offspring. The portraits are very direct. They don’t hold back in showing the viewer what it really takes to care for a child after birth. DeVun also shows that there’s nothing wrong or unnatural with using technology to help with breastfeeding.\n—Anna Mendoza, photo editor, BuzzFeed Australia\n3. \"This Is What International Women’s Day Looked Like Around The World\" — BuzzFeed News\nOn Wednesday, women across the world marked International Women’s Day by marching for various women’s rights, including health care, immigration, freedom from sexual violence, and equal pay. This roundup of images is testament to the incredible power of intercommunication in the digital age, when a woman on one side of the globe can raise her voice in unison with her sisters on the other. As these pictures convey, this year’s International Women’s Day was inspiring beyond belief.\n—Gabriel H. Sanchez, photo essay editor, BuzzFeed News\n4. \"A Crude Awakening\" — Time\nTime should be applauded for taking a sweeping 360-degree look at the effects of the proposed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. Here’s what they have in common\n\nArticle: Nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. Here’s what they have in common\nEvery night for 20 years, Gino Rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters’ beds and whispered an incantation. As rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the South Side of Chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl’s ear as she slept: \"I can and I will.\" The message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep.\n\"You talk to the subconscious. You don’t talk to the conscious,\" Rodriguez says. \"That’s the one that really listens.\"\nThe girls slept \"hot-dog style,\" cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. They occasionally woke up during their father’s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. But each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, \"Today is going to be a great day. I can and I will.\"\nVideo by Diane Tsai for TIME\nNot all days were great—the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. But the three daughters of Puerto Rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. They learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. They bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quinceañeras.\nAnd one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon graduated from Harvard Business School and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. Rebecca Rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. And Gina Rodriguez won a Best Actress Golden Globe for her starring role on Jane the Virgin.\n\"We lived the idea of the American Dream,\" Gina says. \"And they made an environment where that was possible.\"\nThe Rodriguez Family\nLeft and Right: Courtesy of the Rodriguez Family\nThis is a story about nine American families with children, like the Rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. The Emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and Hollywood. The Wojcicki sisters became scientists, CEOs and tech entrepreneurs. The Simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the Antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. The Srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the Gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. The Dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books.\nEach of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same.\nIn selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead.\nSome of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren’t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn’t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids.\nBut other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did.\nWe talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska. We talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. Here are six striking qualities they shared.\nImmigrant Drive\nAs Gino Rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in Chicago, Saroja Srinivasan, a Hindu who is vegetarian, was mastering the art of the hamburger. She and her husband T.P. Srinivasan settled in Lawrence, Kans., with their three small children in the early 1970s, when T.P. joined the math department at the University of Kansas. Everyone they knew was back in India.\n\"We made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community,\" Saroja recalls. That meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the Kansas Jayhawks in a living room adorned with Indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate \"Krishmas,\" their version of Christmas.\nJust like their neighbors, the three Srinivasan children—Sri, Srija and ­Srinija—played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. But they didn’t have chores in the same way their friends did. In the Srinivasan household, less was required—but more was expected.\nThere was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. \"It was more like, ‘Look around. What’s Mom doing? Does she need help?’\" recalls Srinija, the youngest. \"Put things away. Pay attention.\"\nAlso, nobody got an allowance. Instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. \"On the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance,\" says Srinija. \"On the other hand, responsibility for every choice.\" Her older sister Srija put it this way: \"If I took $20, that meant Sri and Srinija couldn’t go to the movies.\"\nThe Srinivasan Family\nLeft and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family\nThe three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S.\nFor the Srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off. Sri would grow up to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the Supreme Court. Srija is the interim deputy chief for the San Mateo County health system, responsible for public-health efforts affecting more than 700,000 Californians. And Srinija is an entrepreneur who was one of the first employees at Yahoo and now sits on the board of Stanford University.\nIn addition to Puerto Rico and India, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from Israel, Haiti, Poland and China. For their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen.\nThe Gay siblings, a Haitian-American trio, grew up in Nebraska. Roxane Gay is a best-selling author and New York Times opinion writer, Joel Gay is one of the youngest black CEOs ever to helm a publicly traded company (Energy Recovery), and Michael Gay Jr. is a civil engineer. Their upbringing was stricter than their friends’: the kids weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn’t go to a friend’s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. None of that was up for discussion. \"Parenting is not a democracy,\" Nicole says.\nThe Gay Family\nLeft: Courtesy of the Gay Family; Right: Cindy Hegger Photography\nAwareness of the im­migrant experience, compounded by the fact that the Gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. \"Success and performance was not a choice. That was an expectation,\" Michael Gay Sr. says. \"Good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about.\" No one received a gold star from \"General Gay and his attaché, Nicole,\" as Joel calls them.\nBeing from Haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. \"They were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere,\" says Roxane. Adds Joel: \"The more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one’s work ethic is.\" He says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created \"an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself.\"\nParent-Teachers\nOn another university campus, far from the Srinivasans in Kansas, Esther Wojcicki was having a pool party. Her husband Stan was chair of the physics department at Stanford, and they regularly hosted barbecues for students and their families. Their daughters Susan, Janet and Anne would interrogate the guests about theoretical physics when they weren’t busy passing hors d’oeuvres or throwing each other in\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " parent who was an immigrant or an educator\nparents were involved in political activism of some kind\nconflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents\nstrong awareness of mortality as children\nthey grew up with much more freedom than their friends END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This Republican mayor has an incredibly simple idea to help the homeless. And it seems to be working.\n\nArticle: Work program gives homeless dignity, hope\nAlbuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful \"There’s a Better Way\" program, which hires panhandlers to work in maintenance jobs and also aims to connect them with services. Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful \"There’s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor's Office)\nRepublican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\"\nThroughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city’s poorest residents told him they didn’t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn’t know where else to go.\nSeeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them.\nNext month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque’s There’s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.\nIn less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.\n\"You can just see the spiral they’ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it’s remarkable,\" Berry said in an interview. \"They’ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.\"\nPanhandlers are hired to beautify the city. (City of Albuquerque Mayor’s Office)\nBerry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A Berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas.\nThere is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout.\nBut that’s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option. When they’ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years.\nKellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level.\n\"Genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are,\" Tillerson said. \"Many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one. They don’t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don’t assume they are lazy.\"\nThe There’s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs.\nTillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID.\n\"He now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed,\" she said. \"It’s life-changing for them. He was one that said, ‘I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.’ \"\nDozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party.\nHe was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness.\nThe program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point. It’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life.\n\"It’s helping hundreds of people,\" Berry said, \"and our city is more beautiful than ever.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " bring the work to them END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is this deadly drug becoming a problem in American schools?\n\nArticle: By Julia Rubin\n\"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict.\nNever even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson.\nWhat Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is—on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods.\nDuring his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. \"He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,\" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. \"He stole painkillers from me, actually.\"\nWhen Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive—legally and on the black market—pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin.\nAndrew went to his parents for help. \"He couldn't get away from the drug,\" says his mom, Pam. \"It's a hunger, it's a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window.\" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up—and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him.\nIn 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. \"It wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin—we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,\" he says. \"It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them.\" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. \"The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,\" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. \"Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.\"\nFor some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. \"It was like I was leading a double life,\" she says. \"I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is.\"\nAt first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. \"I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,\" she admits. \"Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why I was doing all these things.\" Her supplier was 30 years old.\nEmily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore—it was something other kids at her school were doing too.\nOver the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. \"I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober. I had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying,\" Emily says. \"But when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that's when I knew I really had to do something.\"\nIn 2012 and 2013, local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. Cases like Andrew's are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like Emily seem to be more of the exception. And with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, Emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her. She speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse. \"Today I can be a part of things instead of apart from them. It's so hard to describe the pain and the misery I felt, the downward spiral,\" Emily says. \"My worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day getting high.\"\n*Name has been changed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " heroin\nlocal news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Traffic-weary homeowners and Waze are at war, again. Guess who’s winning?\n\nArticle: Tim Connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in Takoma Park, Md. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\nWhen the traffic on Timothy Connor’s quiet Maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, \"Continue on Elm Avenue . . . .\"\nThe marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away. But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor’s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps.\n\"I could see them looking down at their phones,\" said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. \"We had traffic jams, people were honking. It was pretty harrowing.\"\nAnd so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor. Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow.\nHe continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks. That made Connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret.\nWaze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to user's destinations. Here's what you need to know about the app. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n[A warning left on a nanny’s car. License plates stolen. And a Pentagon official in big trouble]\n\"It used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but Google Maps and Waze are letting everyone know,\" said Bates Mattison, a city councilman in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, Ga. \"In some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood.\"\nWhen population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby Interstate 85. In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections.\nThe apps didn’t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn’t have known about otherwise.\nWaze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app’s cartoonish interface. When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow.\nIn Portland, Ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a \"greenway\" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. It worked.\n\"The apps reacted pretty quickly to that,\" said Jonathan Maus, publisher of Bikeportland.org.\nIn California, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs. In the Los Angeles region, Waze’s biggest U.S. market, a City Council person representing Sherman Oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms.\nIt was here that Connor learned that some Waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app. Neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility. But Waze was way ahead of them.\n[A Marine fights to prove he’s innocent of sexual misconduct. Then a lost cellphone is found.]\nIt’s not possible to fool the system for long, according to Waze officials. For one thing, the system knows if you’re not actually in motion. More important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers.\n\"The nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it’s not there,\" said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of communications. The company will suspend users they suspect of \"tampering with the map,\" she said.\nWaze’s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, Mossler said, not to create traffic jams.\n\"That said, the traffic has to go somewhere,\" she said. Although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, Waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said.\nTraffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow.\nThey have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have begun working directly with Waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data.\nThe cut-through disputes \"are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic,\" said Paul Silberman, a traffic engineer with Sabra, Wang & Associates in Columbia, Md.\nThose who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it’s happening at Internet speed.\n\"These great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire,\" Silberman said.\n[Three workers once died rebuilding this bridge. Now a new makeover is under way.]\nIn Takoma Park, Connor complained to the city’s public works and police departments, but nothing stemmed the flow. He put out two plastic watch-for-children figures, but one was hit by a car and the other was stolen.\nConnor and his neighbors put up \"No Through Traffic\" signs. And their city councilman, Tim Male, tried to get Google Maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps’ feedback feature.\nBut still they came. One afternoon, Connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars. One morning, neighbors awoke to a cacophony of honks and went out to find a backup dozens of cars deep, two drivers in the middle about to come to blows.\nSoon after, Connor went rogue. He experimented with Waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports.\n\"It didn’t do much and within two weeks they stopped showing up on the map all together,\" Connor said. \"They were on to me.\"\nThe traffic flow began to wane when the road construction ended, Connor said, but remains three or four times higher than before it began.

But imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from Around here we like good beer, we like good wine, we like good cocktails, and we certainly have had occasion to drink a few too many of those things. But imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from 24/7 Wall Street and compiled using data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute isn’t a top 10 anyone necessarily wants to be a part of. What that data showed was that 7 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 cities most inclined to binge are in the state of Wisconsin.\nNow, as someone who still answers \"Wisconsin\" to the question \"Where are you from?\" I am familiar with the stereotypes of camouflage-coated ice fisherman slamming Millers on frigid January afternoons (or mornings), but this analysis went somewhat deeper than that. It looked at people who either binge drink (4-5 drinks in a sitting) or drink heavily (15 or more drinks per week) over 381 different metro areas.\nNow the caveat to all this, is the numbers are all self reported, so the hopeful Wisconsinite in me wants to believe that people from Wisconsin are just a lot more honest about their drinking than people from California or Utah. Regardless, having nearly 27 percent of the adults in your town claim they drink to excess as they do in Appleton, is not a stat that will likely go up on any welcome signs you’d see at the city limits.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Does Sparkling Water Have a Downside?\n\nArticle: Plain seltzer or sparkling water’s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives.\nSeltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters.\n2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages.\nColas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.\nCarbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It’s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that’s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale).\nBottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.\nAccording to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health.\nAn additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most Americans are already considered too high.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water END"}

Unless it's full-on car-destruction-mayhem from the Jason Bourne shoot.\nThe action-thriller starring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne brought an unprecedented closure to the famed Las Vegas Strip for the spectacular car chase. Things went boom, cars got clobbered.\nThis is especially clear in the Jason Bourne trailer when a SWAT truck driven by Vincent Cassel (known only as The Asset) rolls through Vegas and cars going after Damon's Bourne. We had to ask producer Frank Marshall just how many cars were destroyed in the screen madness.\nMarshall knew the number right off the top of his head: 170 cars.\nAnd how did he know that number so quickly? \"I counted, I had to pay the bills,\" said Marshall, adding that these were just the destroyed cars from the scene. \"They are all in a trash heap somewhere.\"\nProducer Frank Marshall attends the Las Vegas premiere of 'Jason Bourne.'\nWith a little more reluctance, Marshall did cop that this was close to a half-a-million in car costs alone — provided by manufacturers, but modified for the scene.\nIt made for great watching even shooting the stunts which are almost entirely practical (VFX was used to erase safety elements and camera platforms).\nDamon would watch the stunts from his hotel room late into the night, even facing an early morning call the next day for work.\n\"We would shoot all day.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How this 27-year-old made $1 million last year:\n\nArticle: In December 2012, when Michelle Schroeder-Gardner graduated with an MBA, she had $38,000 in student loan debt.\nShe got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months.\nThough it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement.\nSince then, she has increased her income each year.\nIn 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000.\nIn 2014, that increased to $164,000.\nIn 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000.\nAnd last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact.\nPlus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others.\nHer ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports.\nMichelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner)\nIt also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says.\nBut the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive.\nI've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems.\nGrowing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm.\nHere's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly.\nHow did you pay off your student loans so quickly?\nSix months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later.\nSo in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things.\nAs soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it.\nWhat were your expenses during this time?\nMy boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills.\nWhen did the blog start coming into the picture?\nI had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs.\nI started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money.\nUntil then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me.\nMy advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course.\nI also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community.\nHow much did you earn from the blog to begin with?\nIn the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month.\nHow exactly does the blog bring in money?\nNow, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform.\nThe other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done.\nMy third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms.\nWhy did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016?\nIn 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others.\nBy focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%.\nI also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income.\nI was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000.\nHow has your changing income changed your lifestyle?\nAs a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time.\nThe main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever.\nWhy did you start living in an RV?\nMy husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was.\nBut I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports.

There are many tools in our toolbox to make this all possible, and today we're going to talk about one more: the FIFO method of sorting your groceries.\nFIFO stands for first in, first out. It's a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. When the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it. This ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. It's a simple concept, but an effective one.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why 2017 is the year to visit Kathmandu\n\nArticle: With the two year anniversary of the Nepal earthquake approaching, the capital is back on its feet. Now's the time to go, says Martin Symington\nWhy go now?\nThere’s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping Kathmandu back on to its feet. Nearly two years after the earthquake which devastated swathes of Nepal and severely damaged the capital, Kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. Rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the Himalayan city’s sensory overload: temples and squares; prayer flags and sputtering scooters; merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung.\nGet your bearings\nThe old city, known as Durbar Square, lies at the centre of Kathmandu. To its north, frenetic Thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. To the south, the Bagmati River borders peaceful Patan district with its own Durbar Square and expatriate communities. Beyond the former Royal Palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies.\nLocal tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided – they're crowded, slow and not the safest. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances.\nTake a view\nPuff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath (1), known as ‘Monkey Temple’ on account of the hundreds of ‘holy’ monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. If the day is clear, the whole of Kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. You will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed. \nTake a hike\nNowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as Durbar Square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the UNESCO-listed historic heart of Kathmandu.\nStart at the northern, Thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000Rs (about £7.70) fee for free run of the whole area. Join throngs of pilgrims at Shiva-dedicated Mahendreshwar Mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. Follow the flow down to Jagannath Mandir (4), a Hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seems to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts.\nIf it’s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out – the Kumari Devi, or living ‘child-goddess’ might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the Kumari Dar (5). However, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extend of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. Cordoned off for safety is the red brick old Royal Palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent Basantapur Tower (7) somehow remain precariously erect. Exit via ‘Freak Street’ (official name Jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over).\nLunch on the run\nClimb six flights of stairs to the rooftop Kasthamandap Café (9) at 23 Maru (00 977 1 6219177, no web) for an open-air coffee and snack under a sun umbrella. There are commanding views over Durbar Square.\nWindow shopping\nThe Thamel district, north of Durbar Square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to Freak Street). It’s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine Tibetan antiques. One good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is Amrita Craft (10) on Chhetrapait.\nAn aperitif\nOwner Prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to Zibro (11) on Chaksibari Marg (00 977 984 1059449, no web), his laid-back rooftop bar where young Nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying Indians and European travellers. The music is on multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing Nepali folk-rock fusion in the background. It’s a great place to make new friends over a glass of local craft beer Khumbu Kolsch.\nDine with the locals\nAt Bhojan Griha (12), on Dilli Bazaar in the eastern district of Kathmandu, traditional ‘Newari’ dishes are served to guests in a 19th-century mansion, restored with painstaking attention to detail. Dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. The restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. Mains around £6-8.\nTake a ride\nFor the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn ‘Mountain Flight’ along the crest of the Himalayas. You’ll pass up close and personal many of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent.  An hour-long flight with Buddha Air costs US$192 (£158).\nSunday morning: out to brunch\nLa Dolce Vita (13), at Chaksibhari Marg (00 977 1 4700612, no web), doesn’t have the best coffee in Kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious Italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak’s cheese. Sit on the sunny terrace watching the street dramas of chaotic Thamel below. Open from 11am, meals around £8-10.\nA walk in the park\nIt says a lot that Swapna Bagaicha (14) on Kaiser Mahal, Tridevi Marg, is also known as the Garden of Dreams. A botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it’s just a few minutes’ walk from central Thamel. Sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. Nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the Rs 200 (£1.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use.\nCultural afternoon\nThe historic Buddhist city of Patan – effectively a suburb of Kathmandu – is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured Bagmati River. Patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own Durbar Square. Sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. The façade of the Kwa Bahal (15), also known as the Golden Temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned Ashoka Stupas (16) are another. And then there’s the fact it’s guarded by scores of ‘holy tortoises’.\nThe icing on the cake\nTreat yourself to a massage by a Seeing Hands blind masseur whose fingers are attuned to muscle and tissue in ways that the sighted will never match. At the same time, support this commendable organisation which provides employment and independence for Nepal’s blind men and women. A range of therapies are offered in a clinical setting, in its premises off Jyatha Road, Thamel (17).\nGetting there\nQatar Airways flies to Kathmandu via Doha from Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh, from £685 return. Other options include Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Jet Airways via Delhi or Mumbai.   \nStaying there\nHotel Shangri-La (18) is, as the name suggests, as swanky as Kathmandu gets. It’s an inviting, low-rise modern hotel with traditional flourishes in a lush garden with cool pool. Doubles from £105, B&B.\nSomething of a Thamel institution – everyone from Jeremy Irons to Ricky Martin have stayed here – the Kathmandu Guest House (19) is a bit rough round the edges these days, but still a good mid-range choice – it’s located in a former palace. Doubles from £65, B&B.\nOn a budget? Hotel Horizon (20) is a gem tucked away in an alley near the north end of Durbar Square. Breakfast on sequinned cushions in the courtyard is a treat. Doubles from £24, B&B.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping Kathmandu back on to its feet END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: President Trump? There’s only one way to stop it happening\n\nArticle: I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States – and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That’s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States – and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That’s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.\nIf that sounds like panic, then I’m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\"\nNever seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver\nThe source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.\nSo low are expectations for his performance on Monday – where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him – that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton’s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.\nAnd for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She’s been advised that she mustn’t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary’s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.\nActivists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.\nBut Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.\nTake two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.\nThis week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.\nBut Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’\nSo where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she’s dishonest. The risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.\nIf that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.\nWhich brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America’s highest office – but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.\nThis too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency – and no Iraq war.\nI know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America’s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.\nYou might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven’t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure.)\nSo now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an American nightmare.\nYou don’t have to love her. You don’t even have to like her. You’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \"Don’t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\" And the alternative is President Trump.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " vote Clinton. END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Secret Reason Apple Might Be Killing the iPhone headphone jack\n\nArticle: Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone in a few weeks. And, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iPhone 7\nBloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months. The big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It's dead. Dunzo\nLet's all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack.\nNot to downplay the new stuff (though I have thoughts on that, just wait), it's worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iPhone predictions to a tee.\nIn case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iPhone:\nIt will be Apple's fastest iPhone ever.\nIt will have Apple's most advanced optics.\nThere will be at least one extra feature you can't get on any other iPhone.\nIt will come in rose gold.\nAnd now, I guess we can add, \"it won't have a headphone jack.\"\nStill, I'm sure I'm not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iPhone and says, \"Huh. OK.\"\n    If we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.\nThis isn't to say I won't still buy the next iPhone — I'm TOTALLY going to buy the new iPhone in September — but if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.\nPersonally, I think that's OK. I'm not completely sure how I feel about Apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three — new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you've got the latest and greatest phone — but now that we're nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year.\nRegardless of what other whiz-bang goodness Apple introduces this year — and I'm sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate — the reality is that this will absolutely be the iPhone remembered as \"the one where Apple dropped the headphone jack.\"\nThat's it. Pack it up.\nWaterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. And these would be amazing upgrades — old design or not — but the real headline is that this is the first iPhone without a headphone jack.\nI can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact.\nAnd thinking about it, I have to wonder: Is Apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year's iPhone — you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp AMOLED screen — won't suffer? That's the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. It's also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone.\nAnd Apple loves to celebrate anniversaries.\n    A 20th Anniversary Edition Macintosh from 1997. Fun fact: This was one of the first product designs from Jony Ive. Image: Christie's auction house\nDownplaying the iPhone 7 so the NEXT iPhone can thrive\nMaybe I'm reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that Apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year — a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign — in order to protect the next iPhone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack's removal.\n    The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port.\nYes, yes, I've been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since January . A frequent point of discussion on our podcast, MashTalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. Even Tech Editor Pete Pachal has come around to see the light. The jack is dead.\nAnd there will be backlash. The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original iMac.\nI feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iPhone will be minimal. People will grumble. Adapters will be annoying and we'll all bitch and moan about how Bluetooth just isn't good enough. But we'll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either Lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. We'll have moved on.\nWhich of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iPhone will be all positive. New design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. But that missing headphone jack? So last year's problem.\nAnd that's why, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the iPhone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iPhone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iPhone doesn't carry that particular scarlet letter.\nDespite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, I'm still going to buy the iPhone 7. But I mostly just want to get this release over with so I can start looking forward to the iPhone 8. So, I suspect, does Apple.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How one man could have fathered 1000 kids\n\nArticle: Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco, \"The Bloodthirsty,\" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000. Now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years.\nIsmaïl, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. He was Sharifian — that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam.\nIsmaïl's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle.\nAny suspicion of adultery against Ismaïl was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years.\nSome researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismaïl had said.\nTo solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record.\n\"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.\nThe simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles.\nThe simulations suggest Ismaïl needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring — the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women.\nAlthough the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismaïl could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction — you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\"\nOberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco\nhave sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?\n\nArticle: An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.\nThe natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!\nIt was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.\nOne would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.\nThat meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident.\nUnlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened.\nThe conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows.\nThe first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started.\nThe second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction.\nThe nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years.\nSadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed – including the enigma of the \"missing uranium.\"\nFeatured Image: Danilo Russo/Flickr\nSource: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions. END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: How technology will bring loved ones back to life\n\nArticle: The theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years. By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist.\nCurrently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die.\nThe Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents.\nSince the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today.\n\"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\"\nThough Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet.\n\"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives — preservation first, technology second.\"\nMeanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\"\nEarlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions — its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence.\nWhile the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend.\nInspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you.\n\"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\"\nThe goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\"\nBut intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could.\nOver 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public.\nThe natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy.\nLong-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too.\nShe imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone.\n\"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\"\nWhile the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy — edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory — experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved.\nHeather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one.\nMany already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead.\nAfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave.\nIf people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back?\nBoth Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave.\n\"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says.\nBeyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones.\n\"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way?\nDigital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.\nThese services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves. They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data — the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos — and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were.\nUntil we can really can upload our brains to the cloud, that's our best shot at immortality.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves.

Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. However, incidence rates are now converging among white and African-American women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. \"Although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. Death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. In June, a JAMA study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found. Authors of of the ACS report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to ER-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for ER-negative breast cancer, which is more common among African Americans.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Black Women END"}

An international trip, he tells USA TODAY.\nLet friends in your social network know what you are reading about\nPokemon trainers flocked from around the Bay Area to attend San Francisco's Pokemon Go Crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked Pokemon over discounted themed drinks.\nNick Johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every Pokémon in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America.\nSo now what?\nOff on an international trip to catch the Pokémon elsewhere in the world — underwritten by an international travel company.\nMarriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Pokémon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip.\n​Using GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Pokémon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. In the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open — a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions.\n\"I feel great,\" Johnson said. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. I’m a lot healthier — I think I lost about 8-10 pounds.\"\nLaunched in early July , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare Pokémon.\nMr. Mime , Farfetch'd and Kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in Europe, Asia and Australiasia, respectively. However, it is rumored these Pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in North America that users can pick up at PokeStops.\n\"I’ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in North America) as far as I know,\" Johnson said.\nThe Brooklyn-based tech worker announced this week he had nabbed the 142 local monsters on Reddit with a screenshot of his Pokedex, and later confirmed this feat to Business Insider\nHe owes his new fame to plain old shoe leather.\nCentral Park .

He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model.\nHe said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Pokémon games, of course.\nBut staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what Johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for Pokémon, citing a story of trying to catch a Porygon. He said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the Pokémon Go radar was down so he had to order an Uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it.\n\"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\"\nAs for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain Pokémon.\n\"I probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said.\nSecondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good.\n\"I learned that the hard way,\" Johnson said.\nFor now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into Applico.

(Photo by Jose Luis Villegas/the Sacramento Bee via AP)\nLester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News\" will moderate Monday's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable.\nBefore the lights go on, here are five things to know about Holt:\nHolt is a registered Republican\nDonald Trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode.\n\"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're — they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want — and this, I think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that's what they're doing by gaming the system.\"\nConspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be.\n\"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It’s a very unfair system.\"\nThese are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nTime magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.\nHolt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992\nHolt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president.\nHolt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\"\nDominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning.\n\"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\"\nHe's not really into the Twitter\nHolt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these:\nScratching item off list of things I've never done before a newscast. Beach volleyball. Tonight @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com/CRmpnCcpNU — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 7, 2016\nJoining on stage for some Brazilian Jazz in Rio tonight. #BoyFromIpanema pic.twitter.com/xJ5MoYGtPZ — Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 13, 2016\nIn general, however, it is not unusual for Holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession.\nHe moderated a Democratic primary debate\nHolt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell.\nHe was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the \"reset button\" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state.\n\"Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009,\" Holt said. \"Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\"\nHolt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree\nApparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school.\nHolt left California State University-Sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in San Francisco. The Sacramento Bee told the story last year:\nLester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn’t as worried as his wife, June. \"She predicted poverty and failure,\" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism.\nThings worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Holt is a registered Republican\nHolt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992\nHe's not really into the Twitter\nHe moderated a Democratic primary debate\nHolt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The one thing you should never say to someone w/ OCD\n\nArticle: I get it -- knowing how to respond to someone's disorder or disease can be tough. I'm one of those people who gets uncomfortable extremely easily, so I have sympathy for people that look similarly awkward when it comes up that I have obsessive compulsive disorder.\nI also get the desire to not only sympathize, but to empathize by finding some way to relate to this very important, and often dominating, part of my life. Which is the only reason I can assume that I hear this (or some version of this) response so often: \"OMG same! I keep my closet perfectly color-coded!\"\nNow, it's not always color-coding closets -- it could be anything from polishing silverware, to double-checking locks, to eating the same thing every day for breakfast. And yes, OCD symptoms present both in a variety of ways as well as varying degrees. But unless you are educated on the disorder, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- I'm going to be honest and let you know I really, really don't want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis.\nHere's why: It's insensitive to diminish OCD to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\"\nBecause even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and I'll give it to you, maybe even an \"obsession\" or \"compulsion\" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed OCD comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. For my disorder, it's a response that I would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. Thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish.\nNow, I know this isn't your intention, and I try to keep this in mind as I grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing. And don't get me wrong, I'm happy to explain it to you -- but I would much rather do so in response to a question or genuine interest, not a backhanded attempt at empathy.\nMy OCD has affected me for as long as I can remember -- and although it's now managed well enough where it's not necessarily something people notice on their own (a proud accomplishment, if I do say so myself), there have been times it has been debilitating: severe anxiety; bleeding knuckles from obsessive washing; rapid weight drops from stress-related appetite loss; intricate and obscenely repetitive bedtime routines.\nI'm happy to explain this to you, to answer any and all questions -- anyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly a shy or private person. But please, take this route instead of attempting to relate in a way that, unless you actually have diagnosed OCD, you would never be able to.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Scientists say this behavior can make men more attractive to women\n\nArticle: Scores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isn't just about the way you look.\nFrom being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women — especially if you're looking to land a long-term relationship.\nA growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: Men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don't.\nIn a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships.\nSome of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\"\nBoth men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships — but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did.\nMore recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks.\nIn a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men.\nAbout 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive.\nThe women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive.\nEach pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person.\nAll the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship.\nThe researchers walked away with several key findings.\nFirst, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men.\nSecond, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men.\nPerhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. Unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism.\nIt's hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. But they do suggest that, if you're a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn't hesitate to flaunt the fact that you're an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week.\nIt could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " altruism END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How AI could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined\n\nArticle: It’s an experience many shoppers have had: You’re queued in line at the store prepared to make a purchase only to have your credit card declined for no apparent reason. A perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise.\nMasterCard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. It’s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience.\nFinancial institutions have for years collected data on customers’ habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. That’s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. The system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision.\n\"The old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules. With a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives,\" said Todd Marlin, a principal in Ernst & Young’s forensic technology and discovery services practice.\n\"What we’re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence,\" Marlin said.\nMachine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. For example, the system might detect that you haven’t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. Or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate.\nCiting a survey from Javelin Advisory Services, MasterCard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the United States in 2014 — well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. That’s a large sum of money that retailers — and credit card purveyors like MasterCard — could be pocketing.\nMasterCard’s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. The system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. Each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer’s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. The company called it \"the first use of AI being implemented on a global scale directly on the MasterCard network.\"\n\"For this to work we need all kinds of data coming in,\" said Ajay Bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at MasterCard. \"We’ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network.\n\"We see this as a critical component of our future strategy,\" Bhalla added. \"We are embedding AI in everything we’re looking at as a company.\"\nFor the last decade, Visa has deployed its Visa Advanced Authorization system to detect fraud. The volume of data and the speed at which it’s processed have increased considerably over that time, said Mark Nelsen, the company’s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. Visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases.\n\"We can look at that transaction and, knowing what we’ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad,\" Nelsen said.\nDigital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. PayPal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. \"There’s a magnitude of difference — you’ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated,\" PayPal’s senior director of global risk and data sciences, Hui Wang, told American Banker.\nBut Visa, MasterCard and PayPal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said Celent analyst Arin Ray. While most in the industry think AI holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report Ray co-authored in August.\n\"The concept of AI has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. The volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it],\" Ray said in an interview.\n\"One [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations. Since it’s still unproven technology, they don’t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure,\" he said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " MasterCard’s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 8 things that will be more expensive next month\n\nArticle: 1. Cold-Weather Clothing © Provided by Gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive In July, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into August and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. This means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. You might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won’t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. A great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. For example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during August and September, according to Consumer Reports. Another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts. The discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like Target, Sears and Kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase.\n2. Back-to-School Supplies\n© Provided by Gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive Not surprisingly, August is a big month for back-to-school shopping. Sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. Since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during August, it’s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive \"loss leaders,\" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins — like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It’s an exciting time for kids, and it’s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff.\n3. Theme Park Tickets © Provided by Gobankingrates theme park tickets expensive The summer season is an ideal time for a family to The summer season is an ideal time for a family to head to a popular theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. Typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late August, during the week of Thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. Because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to Nasdaq.com. Not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. So you’re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. Dave Shute, co-author of \"The Easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit\" recommended vising Disney World between the second week of Easter and the week before Memorial day, mid-to-late October, any week in November other than Thanksgiving, and during December up to a week before Christmas.\n4. Patio Furniture © Provided by Gobankingrates patio furniture expensive The last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until September to really drop prices on these goods, according to DealNews. August is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. Since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to HowMuchIsIt.org, it’s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. Keep in mind that popular stores like Sears and Home Depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of August, according to personal finance advice website SmartAsset. But if you buy before Labor Day, you’ll likely pay more than you would later, according to CBS News.\n5. Televisions © Provided by Gobankingrates televisions expensive Deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on HDTVs in August. Prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. If you need to purchase a new TV before the prime season, DealNews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch TV or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. Also, college students who want to upgrade the TVs or LCDs in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices.\n6. iPhones and iPads © Provided by Gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive August is a terrible time to August is a terrible time to upgrade your Apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in September or October, reported DealNews. This means the price on an Apple device purchased in August will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. If you’re in the market for a new iPhone or iPad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall.\n7. Bicycles © Provided by Gobankingrates bicycles expensive August is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it’s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. If you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in August and lasting through December, according to Consumer Reports. Just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. So the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to Bicycling.com. The site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. Advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a \"great deal\" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay\n\nArticle: If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour.\nFast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)\nNotice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.\nThe gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.\nOther measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women.\nBailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.\nTake the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).\nRather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far.\nThe Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed.\nThere are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.\nStill, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.\nThe Olympic tax\nSpeaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.\nBut the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.\nThe Fed\nNewly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question.\nThe Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.\nNumber of the week\nBack in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why a South Carolina man got bail after he shot, buried and ‘slow-cooked’ two people\n\nArticle: Early in the morning on March 5, James Edward Loftis found himself facing two men in his South Carolina home. The men were demanding cab fare for the ride Loftis had just received.\n\"I’ll get your money,\" he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after.\nInstead, the warrant said, Loftis retrieved a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men.\nHe then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document.\nOn Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the Post and Courier . A prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against Loftis.\nNonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old James Cody Newland.\n\"He’s a human being,\" defense attorney Stephen Harris said, according to the Post and Courier. \"He freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. Nobody knows how you’re going to react when you kill two people.\"\nHarris said what Loftis did after the shooting was \"heinous,\" according to the Post and Courier.\nBerkeley County Deputy Solicitor Bryan Alfaro said the prosecution would continue pursuing the case, given Loftis’s inconsistent accounts of whether the men forced their way into the home or whether he let them in — a crucial part of his defense, according to the Post and Courier, because of South Carolina’s \"stand your ground\" law, which grants protection to homeowners who use deadly force against intruders.\nStand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed African American teenager in Florida. An attorney for George Zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told CNN that they had weighed Florida’s stand-your-ground law before finding Zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.\nGun rights advocates say such laws codify the right to protect one’s home, while opponents say they legalize the sometimes-deadly use of force.\nOn Monday, Alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted Loftis’s actions in gruesome detail.\n\"They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site,\" he said.\nFollowing the brutal events that early-March morning, Loftis did not call police. His wife did.\nWilda Loftis told the authorities that her husband was having suicidal thoughts and had told her that he had killed \"them\" and put \"them\" in the back yard, according to the original arrest-warrant affidavit.\nAfter police arrived, she showed them bullet holes in the living room, above the couch. Investigators made their way to the backyard and discovered a disturbed patch of dirt. Then, they spoke to Loftis, who explained what happened.\nIf and when Loftis posts his $250,000 bail — probably this week, the Post and Courier reported — he will be on house arrest, allowed only to leave for work, church, or visits with a doctor or his lawyer, according to the Post and Courier.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why has this photo gone viral online?\n\nArticle: A group of men standing around a desk: it is not the typical image that goes viral online.\nThe photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions.\n\"Men making decisions about women's bodies\" was a much-repeated phrase on Twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author JK Rowling.\nThe concern over lack of women at the table comes as Mr Trump's cabinet attracts attention for the high proportion of white, male nominations.\nAnd while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be.\nViral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story. So here is an at-a-glance look at what President Trump's executive order means.\nIs this a step towards banning abortion in the US?\nNot in itself. This particular executive order is relevant outside of US borders.\nThe policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\".\nThis particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited.\nAlthough this policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home.\nHis signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority.\nIs President Trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding?\nRepublicans and Democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades.\nRepublican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions.\nBut Democrats later rescinded it under the Clinton administration.\nIt was reinstated when President George W Bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by President Barack Obama in 2009. And now it is back.\nWhat has all this got to do with Mexico City?\nThe order's official name is the Mexico City Policy because President Reagan first implemented it at a United Nations population conference in Mexico City.\nAnd why is it sometimes nicknamed the 'global gag law'?\nCritics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning.\nIf they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation.\nHowever, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administration's swift move.\n\"President Trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of US pro-life organisation Susan Anthony List.\nIs it unusual to have so many men at the table?\nNo. Like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials.\nMany on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the US - was delivered by an all-male Supreme Court.\nThe Roe v Wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks.\nWhat are Mr Trump's views on abortion?\nThe new US president has previously changed his mind on the issue. He has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest.\nOn the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed \"some form of punishment\" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned.\nBut, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman.\nIn an interview with CBS News, Mr Trump said: \"The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.\"\nHe refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: FUNBAG! What's better summer sex or winter sex?\n\nArticle: Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we’re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more.\nI took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop.\n\"You’re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you’re lying, I’ll never stop for you to poop again.\"\nBut he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it’s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald’s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we’re getting home.\nI think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over.\n\"I don’t think he’s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really.\nSponsored\nOn the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don’t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place.\nNow, your letters:\nDan:\nI don’t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren’t they even mentioning it?\nI think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care. Of course they care. You’d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don’t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it.\nBut it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well:\n\"To me, I think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell. That’s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do.\"\nI mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth.\nThat’s why Winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel’s drinking did. It’s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That’s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It’s not the boozing. It’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft.\nYou know what’s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I’m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It’s quite something.\n(By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota’s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven’t learned to be sick of him yet.)\nKyle:\nAre BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I’m suspicious of the whole thing.\nBut the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can’t hurt you at all! That’s science.\nI used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this.\nThe truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " She says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This company wants to solve all your scanning and filing problems\n\nArticle: Most staple removers fit in the palm of your hand. This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence.\nRipcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn’t made it into the information age – billions of boxes of paper files.\n``We’re drowning in problem,’’ said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.’’\nLike many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access.\nRipcord’s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they’re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer.\nWith billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that’s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord’s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software.\nRipcord isn’t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It’s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord.\nThe machines aren’t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn’t putting people out of work, it’s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached.\n\"We’re not replacing people with machines, we’re giving them much more interesting things to do,\" Fielding said. \"I don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ripcord END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is there a better way to observe Veteran's Day?\n\nArticle: All this isn’t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don’t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn’t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.\nDifferences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America’s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America’s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS’s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Ideas about how to bridge the gender gap on pay.\n\nArticle: So what might work to close the gap? Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces.\nPublish Everyone’s Pay\nWhen employers publish people’s salaries, the pay gap shrinks.\nJake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees’ arguments in wage bargaining. \"Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,\" he said.\nThat has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men.\nWomen might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits.\nA few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately.\nMarc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women’s salaries equal to men’s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions.\nTo Negotiate, or Not\nMen are paid more partly because they’re much more likely to ask for it.\nWhen receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested.\nBecause starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found.\nBut her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn’t fight for more because \"I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’ \")\nOne solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations.\nAnother answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.\n\"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.\nDon’t Rely on Previous Salaries\nIf women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.\nGoogle has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth.\nIn August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee’s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors.\n\"Don’t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\" Ms. Babcock said. \"I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\"\nMake Work Easier for Mothers\nResearch has found that salaries at men and women’s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children.\nSometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they’ll do so, even if they don’t.\nPolicies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found.\n\"If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that’s not the same as making a career choice,\" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. \"One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.\"\nBuild More Flexible Workplaces\nMs. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren’t penalized as much for working fewer hours.\nCompanies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient.\nChange the Law\nFederal law doesn’t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics.\nThe strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay.\nProposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier. But that legislation is stalled in Congress.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Men are paid more partly because they’re much more likely to ask for it.\nmakes offers based on what a job is worth\nMake Work Easier for Mothers\nBuild More Flexible Workplaces\nChange the Law END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: When's the best time to share on Facebook?\n\nArticle: There’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts.\nCoSchedule, Fast Company, HubSpot, ShortStack, Forbes, Hootsuite, QuickSprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as \"When is the best time to post on Facebook?\" and \"How often should you post stories on Facebook?\"\nHowever, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook.\nWe analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.\nFirstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.\nAs can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.\nIt’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.\nThe natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?\nWe compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.\nOverall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.\nWe also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.\nInterestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.\nAgain, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.\nBut even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists.\nFeatured Image: Nick Shepherd/Getty Images\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Does Sean Bean Really Die More Than Other Actors?\n\nArticle: One does not simply... assume.\nActor Sean Bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. He’s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.\nStart looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?\nI crafted the following chart to find out:\nClick to enlarge!*\nIt looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.\nHowever, even though Bean has perfected his \"I’m dying\" face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.\nBut the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt’s death percentage is similar to Bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of Hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive.\nHe has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven’s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L’Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You’re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.\nMaybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.\nSo is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)\nOf course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt).

Consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes.\nAs we prepare to open our production of God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell in New York City next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of Hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity.\nIt seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show.

Mankind has moved so far from the way God intended us to live, we must return to God's way of living, it is the best way and the blessed way, hope you can understand. Kind regards, Ruby\nPunctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have.\nI worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.\nThe truth is, Ruby can't be naïve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue.\nPerhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set. I also have a full page of ad space that I don't know what to do with. Maybe this:\nThe chandelier in tonight's performance comes from Ivory & Deene's collection of exquisite heteronormative lighting. To find out if you yourself are fit to own these fine straight-people products, ask yourself this: \"Do I like gay sex?\"\nThis question might also help you determine whether or not you'll dig our show.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The one place this Google executive won't take her phone\n\nArticle: Is there one place you choose to honor with your full attention? Our \"Sacred Spaces\" series explores where your phone is unwelcome. From the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. Want to share your own? Send us your story here.\nI’ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance.\nTo me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way.\nSomething about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself.\nEveryone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. So there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) who are there with me.\nThe truth is, that during class, I never looked at my phone. But one time I did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. My boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and I had just decided to check my email. Email draws you in and there’s always some action item -- something that triggers a response.\nFor the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. Remembering the exercise, going across the floor. That one email check pulled into class what I should be doing after class. I lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. I realized that I had invaded my sacred space with technology.\nAnd though I didn't typically look at my phone, once I set up the rule that I would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait.\nBonita Stewart is Vice President of Partner Business Solutions at Google. As told to Meredith Melnick. This interview was edited and condensed for space and clarity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ballet studio END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: SalesforceVoice: 3 ways to make your company more sales intelligent\n\nArticle: You've heard of street smarts and book smarts. But is your company sales smart? If you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. Sales teams face two perennial problems. No matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently.\nYou can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it.\nBecoming Sales Intelligent\nModern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs.\nThis is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. Organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages.\nA few years ago, they would have used simple Google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments.\nSales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101. But sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past.\nStill, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. Sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. Sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. But they're effective only if you approach them correctly. Here's how to build sales intelligence within your company:\n1. Emphasize productivity.\nThe greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. You most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. Rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. Cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. They'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell.\n2. Evaluate potential ROI.\nThe big questions with new tools are always: How much will this cost? And what's the ROI? Analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. Then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. That will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. Usually, the answer is yes.\n3. Investigate key features.\nSales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. They may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. If you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. Have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization.\nSales intelligence is critical to your company's growth. What obstacles are preventing you from embracing these tools, and what would inspire more confidence in them?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. Emphasize productivity.\n2. Evaluate potential ROI.\n3.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is how much a gold medal from #Rio2016 is really worth:\n\nArticle: The Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games is being billed as the \"Biggest Sporting Event on the Planet.\" It’s difficult to argue against that claim as more than 11,000 athletes will be competing in 28 sports and 42 disciplines for the event’s ultimate prize: the gold medal.\nThe \"podium value\" of the gold medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $43.76 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of Thursday. This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time.\nIf the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded.\nA total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil. All of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the Summer Olympics and tied for the largest medal in the Summer games. At least three Winter Olympic medals were larger and heavier.\nEach of the 812 Olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the International Olympic Committee) with 99.9 percent purity. The remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the Mint of Brazil. The purity silver standard also is a minimum IOC requirement.\nEach of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. The podium value is about $305. The 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). The bronze medals have little intrinsic value.\nFor the first time in history, according to Rio Olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm.\nSustainable Design\nThe medals were produced with methods that the Rio 2016 Olympic officials described as \"symbols of sustainability and accessibility .\" More than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and X-ray plates. The gold is mined entirely free of mercury. More than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the Mint of Brazil through a process that was developed internally.\nEven the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). Each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the Rio 2016 logo.\nThe front of each medal has the Rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient Olympics). The reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the Greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the Greek Panathnaic Stadium in the background. Above Nike is the engraving of \"XXXI Olympiad\" and the Olympic Rings. Adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge.\nParalympic medals with new sound innovation\nThe 2,642 Paralympic award medals were made by the Mint of Brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the Olympic medals. The design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal. Olympic officials say the seeds represent \"the courage, persistence and development of athletes.\" The Rio 2016 Paralympic Games logo is on both sides of the medal, with Braille inscriptions on the front side.\nFor the first time the medals come with sound, so visually impaired athletes can identify the medal’s color . Metal ball bearings were placed inside the medals which rattle when shaken. The gold medal makes the loudest noise and the bronze the weakest.\nMore than 100 employees in various professional fields—including, art, sustainability, engineering and production—were involved in the making of the 5,130 medals.\nAnthony DeMarco is founder of the Jewelry News Network.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Chewbacca Mom Shares REAL Reason Her Video Blew Up The Internet\n\nArticle: In the age of viral media, it’s not uncommon for a video to go crazy viral or a post to been seen by millions of eyes.\nIn fact, never before in history has someone had the ability to be plucked from obscurity and rise to a national — or international — platform as quickly as in this 21st century digital age.\nWe see it all the time: from the announcement of Sarah Palin as a running mate in 2008; thrusting her into the spotlight from obscurity, to the boy who cried \"Damn Daniel\" on Vine and ended up on the Ellen show and just about everywhere else. It’s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame.\nThe newest member of the \"Gone Viral\" club is none other than Texas native Candace Payne. A wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, Payne seemed to be all over your Facebook Newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a Facebook Live video of her unboxing a \"Chewbacca\" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral.\nWe’re talking – \"It broke the internet.\"\nLiterally, Candace Payne’s video has set new records as being the most-viewed Facebook Live video with over 133 MILLION views.\nBut just hours after her video blew up the internet, Payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we – for the first time – have begun to understand why Candace’s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as Chewbacca in the front seat of a car.\nShe walked into Kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but little did Candace know that God had other plans for her.\n\"I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,\" Payne told \"I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,\" Payne told Good Morning America . \"I was there for myself for some yoga pants because I’m trying to work out more. And it’s not really going that well, but I ended up going to the toy section because I got discouraged about the yoga pants and I thought, ‘Maybe not today. But I can get a toy for my kids.’ And I walk through the toy section and I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. And I had seen this before, but I didn’t realize it made sounds until that moment. It accidentally started making the growl, and I went, ‘I need to get that. Like, I don’t think my kids need that, I think I need that.’\"\nA few minutes later, Candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be \"responsible\" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. But with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn’t contain herself and decided to do an ‘unboxing’ in her car and show her friends on Facebook her new find.\nSo with a smile that’s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the \"Chewie\" mask out of the box and put it on.\nThen laughter ensued. Candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn’t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. And as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. To the point that she couldn’t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes.\nI was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time I watched Candace’s hilarious video. I’ve seen plenty of viral videos before — in fact, it’s a part of my job. But something is different about Candace Payne.\n\"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 14:17\nCandace is no ordinary \"15-minute-famer.\" In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if Candace’s influence extends long past 15 minutes.\nNot only is Payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she’s someone who loves Jesus too. And boy does it show. Candace is active in her church, The Oaks Fellowship in Red Oak, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and she’s a dedicated wife and momma.\nJust 48 hours after her video had gone viral, Candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an Arts conference in Texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from Heaven.\n\"When I was 16, I had a vision and a dream from the Lord about my future being used for His glory. I didn’t understand the interpretation of it. I still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. But that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that I walk and follow Jesus. And I know that God has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, I feel like I wake up and I’m a Jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because I have that creative buzz in me, constantly going,\" said Candace.\nBut here’s where her words get really good.\n\"It doesn’t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you’re not fit to do the things that God has called you to do... And that is spiritually fit. The thing that will take you further and farther in the Kingdom of God is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... Do not try to make a name for yourself. His name will always outshadow yours.\" -Candace Payne\nAnd that’s not all of the mic drop moments Candace spoke. Take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the Regional Fine Arts event:\n\"I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 15:13\nOne of the markers of Jesus’ work in your life is that you have joy. It doesn’t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren’t words to explain.\nOften, a hallmark of the Holy Spirit’s work in your life is joy. And many times that comes in the form of laughter — deep, beautiful laughter — that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others.\nCandace Payne’s video went viral not just because she’s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). Her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is FILLED with the love and joy of Jesus. And God used a beautiful daughter from Texas, in a Chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic Star Wars toy to bring joy to people’s lives.\n\"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.\" -Philemon 1:7\nDon’t believe me? As if the record-breaking 133 Million views isn’t enough (that’s more views than Mark Zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video:\nCandace shared on Candace shared on Good Morning America that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched Candace’s hilarious stunt.\n\"From one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven’t seen laugh, those are the stories that I’m going to take with me everyday,\" said Candace.\nThe world is hungry — no, they’re starving — for the joy of the Lord. The Bible says that His joy is our strength. If you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking God to give you His joy and then belly-laugh along with Candace. Then go and spread your joy with others and you’ll find that your joy will be always flowing.\nAnd apparently Candace agrees with me as she said this morning on Good Morning America :\n\"I think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. I think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism — worldwide.\"\nThank you so much Candace Payne for sharing the joy of the Lord that is inside of you with the world. You have no idea how inspiring you really are... Or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the Spirit come out of you so freely. Either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine.\n\"Those who have been ransomed by the LORD will return. They will enter Jerusalem singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness.\" -Isaiah 35:10\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: People with this personality type may be happier and more successful\n\nArticle: Are you a \"glass half-full\" or a \"glass half-empty\" kind of person?\nAs it turns out, some people can be both. So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found.\nThese realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]\nOptimists and pessimists\nPast research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said.\nOptimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall.\nAfter several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed.\nSo Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality.\nRealistic views\nThe optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists.\n\"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said.\nInterestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said.\nTraditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy.

They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said.\nThat allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present.\nBeing a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said.\nThe findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said.\nIn order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " realistic optimists END"}

He told the Leader that he took issue with those garments being worn around young students, as he felt their message could interfere with his ability to parent on issues such as same-sex relationships.\n\"My wife and I know our kids better than anyone else and, when it’s time to breach certain subjects to talk about certain areas, that should be up to us as parents,\" said Elmer, according to local outlet KY3.\nHowever, he said he is not opposed to students belonging to gay-straight alliances, called GSAs for short.\n\"The shirt itself is not offensive.

J.K.Rowling let slip these hints about what has happened to our favorite characters, and the Wizarding World in general.\n1/33. Dolores Umbridge was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned for crimes against Muggleborns.\n2/33. After his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the Kings Cross-like Limbo.\n3/33. The Resurrection Stone is now buried in the Forbidden Forest after being pressed into the ground by a centaurs hoof. It has not been re-discovered.\n4/33.

Viktor Krum fell in love with a woman back home in Bulgaria and presumably lived happily ever after.\n6/33. The Death Eaters Dark Marks eventually faded to look like a scar. It will no longer burn or hurt.\n7/33. The Quibbler is back to publishing articles about the lunatic fringe and is appreciated for its unintentional humour.\n8/33. The remaining Death Eaters were killed or imprisoned in Azkaban for their crimes, with the exception of the Malfoys. Draco and Harry never became friends, but they did come to understand and appreciate each other better.\n9/33. Hagrid was still working at Hogwarts by 2017, at 88 years old. He never married, although he had a relationship with a giantess.\n10/33. Harry would take his family to visit Dudleys when they were in the neighbourhood (occasions dreaded by James, Albus and Lily).\n11/33. Nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (McGonagall was really getting on a bit) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemorts death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.\n12/33. Kingsley Shacklebolt became the Minister of Magic after the Second Wizarding War.\n13/33. Harry will not train to be an animagus\nhis energies are going to be concentrated elsewhere and hes not going to have time to do that.\n14/33.

Harry, Ron and Neville went straight to get training as aurors. \n16/33. After serving as an auror for a number of years, Neville Longbottom eventually moved on to serve as the Herbology professor at Hogwarts.\n17/33. The head of the Auror Office as of 2007 is Harry Potter. Harry will never become Headmaster of Hogwarts since an academic career just isnt him.\n18/33. Ron worked with George in Weasleys Wizard Wheezes prior to officially becoming an auror.\n19/33. After the war was over, Hermiones first act was to find her parents in Australia and restore their memories. Harrys was to make sure that the Wizarding world knew that Snape was a hero and on Dumbledores side.\n20/33. Azkaban no longer uses Dementors as guardians. The number of Dementors has been greatly diminished because despair and degradation have been lessened in the world.\n21/33. Hermione tells Scrimgeour that she is not planning to embark on a career in Magical Law. Ironically, thats where she ends up. She advanced the rights of magical creatures and eradicated the old pro-pure-blood laws in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, of which she is the head.\n22/33. Lavender Brown was attacked by Fenrir Greyback during the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione saved her but she was already injured. What happened to her later on was never revealed.\n23/33. Members of the DA still have their coins, as they are like badges of honor. Neville Longbottoms students were impressed when he showed them his Dumbledores Armys Coin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Dolores Umbridge was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned for crimes against Muggleborns.\nAfter his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the Kings Cross-like Limbo.\nThe Resurrection Stone is now buried in the Forbidden Forest after being pressed into the ground by a centaurs hoof.

Unlike traditional nail lacquers that require a steady hand and a long drying time, aerosol-based nail polishes allow you to spray on a manicure in under 20 seconds. Amazing, right?\nThough you may have come across that \"As Seen on TV\" infomercial for Spray Perfect, the company that's actually credited with revolutionizing the product is London-based company Nails Inc. Their Paint Can sprays are now available stateside in three highly pigmented shades, including Hoxton Market (a hot pink), Mayfair Lane (a pastel pink) and Shoreditch Lane (a gleaming silver).\nMilk Makeup and China Glaze have recently added spray-on nail polishes to their beauty lines, proving that this trend isn't going anywhere any time soon.\nHere's exactly how it works, demonstrated in GIFs by Nails Inc.\nYou start by applying a base coat -- because you've got to protect your natural nails and provide a smooth surface for the pigment to adhere to. You can either use your own traditional brush-on base coat, or one that may be sold with your spray-on polish.\nNext, shake up the can and spray on your nail polish. Pro tip: Place a paper towel or old newspaper to prevent getting product all over the place. And be sure to hold the bottle at least 3 to 5 inches above your hand to evenly disperse the pigment.\nDon't worry about getting the spray-on nail polish all over your fingers -- you can remove the excess paint by simply washing your hands or using a makeup remover wipe.\nSeal your manicure with a traditional top coat and you're done!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " spray-on nail polishes END"}

The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures’s emails.\nInvestigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.\nThe way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, SWIFT. The system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in Brussels, and prides itself on security.\nThe New York Times adds:\nNorth Korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why it's definitely worth it to get your flu shot\n\nArticle: Oct 28 - When her law office offered flu shots in mid-October, Kelly Walsh, a paralegal in Boston, hesitated.\nWalsh didn't get vaccinated last year and didn't get sick. The year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot.\n\"I also worried if everyone at work knew I got a flu shot, it'll be harder to take sick days if I do get the flu,\" says Walsh, 38.\nUltimately, however, Walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season.\nThe CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year.\nOne reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies.\nEmployers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. The CDC estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations. Part of those costs are then passed along to employers in the form of higher premiums and lost productivity.\nTypically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. Many large firms like Walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small.\nLast winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown.\nFlu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"But now is the time to get vaccinated,\" she adds.\nWhat's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nSeveral vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic.\nEveryone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. \"We don't prefer one vaccine over another,\" Jhung says. \"Whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy.\"\nThe elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu.\nGetting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. Only 42 percent of Americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the CDC.\nAs an added bonus, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. Based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people.\nPeter Delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rite Aid before getting his flu shot. \"There was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70,\" says Delgado, who lives nearby. The high-dose version of the shot, recommended for older people, often costs more than the normal vaccine.\nHis wife, however, soon sent him back in. \"I told him, 'If you get sick from the flu and can't work, you'll feel foolish over $70,'\" says Anne Delgado, 66, who is retired. \"One shot could mean food on the table for us.\" (Follow us @ReutersMoney or at http://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance; Editing by Lauren Young and Meredith Mazzilli)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: BAD NEWS for workaholics\n\nArticle: If you're addicted to checking your email and regularly work through evenings, weekends and vacations, you might be a workaholic -- and your health may be suffering because of it. Recent research has found a link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being.\nThe Kansas State University study, which will be published in the journal Financial Planning Review, found that well-being is generally not a priority for workaholics.\n\"We found workaholics -- defined by those working more than 50 hours per week -- were more likely to have reduced physical well-being, measured by skipped meals,\" doctoral researcher, Sarah Asebedo, said in a statement. \"Also, we found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score.\"\nTo figure out why some choose to work overtime even when they know it's not good for health, the researchers turned to a mathematical analysis called Becker's Theory of the Allocation of Time, which helps to measure the cost of time. The theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income. it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively.\n\"[Becker's Theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good,\" Asebedo said in the statement. \"This theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more. If you are not engaged in work-related activities, then there is a cost to the alternative way in which time is spent. Even if you understand the negative consequences to workaholism, you may still be likely to continue working because the cost of not doing so becomes greater.\"\nThe findings are based on data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth that included 12,686 young men and women. All the study participants were interviewed each year until 1994, and are still interviewed biennially.\nOf course, it's no secret that overworking can have a negative effect on your health and happiness. A number of studies have shown the detrimental toll that work stress in particular can take on your health, including depression and an increased risk of heart attack and diabetes. And workaholism in particular has been associated with poor sleep quality, weight gain, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, not to mention unhappy marriages and higher divorce rates.\nAnd with the possibility to work from anywhere, at anytime, it's easier than ever to become a workaholic in the first place. More than eight in 10 Americans are stressed about their jobs -- citing an unreasonable workload as their number-one stressor -- and 61 percent of employed vacationers will work through their vacation this year (up from 52 percent last year).\nBut turning on that out-of-office autoreply and taking some time to rest and recharge can actually have a positive effect on not just your well-being, but also your productivity. Even a short nap can boost cognitive functioning, improving creative thinking, learning and memory.\n\"Renewal is not for slackers,\" Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, told the Huffington Post. \"Renewal is a way in which to increase your capacity to be more effective.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being END"}

That’s just one piece of a much bigger problem\n\nArticle: The hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for Earthbound folk. (ESA/NASA)\nWhen you sit around imagining life aboard the International Space Station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. And you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it.\nEspecially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of Earth.\n[NASA reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’]\nBut that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s Cupola, a European-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken.\n\"I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris,\" British astronaut Tim Peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. \"Yes — this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!\"\nUm, yeah. You can say that again.\nNASA released an animation depicting space trash in motion around Earth. (YouTube/NASA)\nThe astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. And the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across. According to the European Space Agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across.\nA FLAKE OF PAINT. Let that sink in.\nBecause of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth.\nThe danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film \"Gravity,\" in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk.\nSpace junk is definitely a real concern. Mashable reports that NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of.\nThese days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of END"}

That’s more recent than any quarterback on the Eagles roster and three years after the Eagles’ most recent playoff win.\nSo why did the Eagles sign him?\nTebow could become a zone-read specialist.\nThe Eagles have utilized the zone-read option a league-high 514 times the last two seasons, 235 times more than the next closest team (Seahawks).\nIn his NFL career, Tim Tebow has kept on 41 zone-read options for 256 yards.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Bernie Sanders Makes MAJOR Announcement To His Entire Staff And Followers (QUOTES)\n\nArticle: Sources close to the Sanders campaign have reported that the Vermont Senator will begin laying off a large part of his staff starting Wednesday. The reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of Clinton’s victories in New Jersey and California, though some of them might be offered jobs in Sanders’ Senate office.\nA lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well.\nThe reports of the layoff came after Clinton’s victory on Tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in California and New Jersey. It is important to note that despite Clinton’s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. She currently has 2,184 compared to Sanders 1,804. There are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.\nClinton, who has been declared the party’s nominee by many in the media, such as the AP, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. Super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate. The super delegates will not vote until the Democratic National Convention, which will be held the last week of July.\nDespite the layoffs, Sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November. It is an argument that Sanders has made throughout this primary season and it’s one that the poll numbers back up. The majority of polls have Sanders defeating Trump by a larger margin than Clinton does. A spokesman for the campaign, Micheal Briggs, reiterated this plan during a statement at a Sanders rally that was held on Monday in San Francisco.\n‘Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump’\nSanders has a long road ahead of him if he hopes to convince the party’s super delegates to back him over Clinton, as many of them have been strong supporters of her campaign since she first announced her candidacy. The Clintons have enjoyed strong support among the Democratic Party since Bill Clinton’s election in 1992.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Yes, Donald Trump Won Latinos Over Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Here’s Why.\n\nArticle: STRANGE BUT TRUE\nWhy the Republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with Latino voters in Nevada—and win the White House as a result.\nWe know about the Reagan Democrats. In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president.\nWell, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\nYou may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime,\" and that they were \"rapists,\" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, \"some are good people.\" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor.\nBehold, the Trump Latinos.\nAccording to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent.\nI can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by Trump’s strong showing with Latinos.\nThe first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.\nTrump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.\nThe other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.\nNow, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about Latinos.\nGranted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That’s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.\nAnd, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren’t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.\nStill, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.\nBut first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states—Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.\nNext, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes. It’s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.\nFinally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.\nLike their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other.\nThat is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they’ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won’t.\"\nNow, here’s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American—is highly aspirational. They don’t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don’t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.\nIn states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.\nAnd what about Trump’s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?\nIt’s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.\nThey’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young DREAM’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.\nLike Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else.\nMeanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.\nThe East Coast media don’t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos.\nFor instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true.\nLatinos don’t want to apart from America, and they aren’t in conflict with America. They are the essence of America.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Trump has a theory.

But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense.\n\"Pulitzer’s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism,\" Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride said in a statement. \"He envisioned that future generations would make changes in the Plan of Award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.'

{"prompt": "Clickbait: According To This Study, Drinking Fizzy Drinks Can Have A Disturbing Effect On Your Penis\n\nArticle: Drinking too much of the black stuff could leave you with not enough of the white stuff. Syda Productions/Shutterstock\nThough there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the Internet – largely led by English tabloids – has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man’s sperm count by as much as thirty percent.\nExactly why this has suddenly become so widely talked about is a bit of a mystery, since as far as we are aware there is no new research to speak of. However, the findings of the study are worth bearing in mind if you happen to be a lover of the self-appointed \"Real Thing\" (and a man).\nAfter examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. Though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes.\nHow these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as the cause, after finding no connection between caffeine in other drinks and sperm count.\nA number of other studies have in the past attempted to find a connection between excessive soda drinking and poor sexual health in men, though most have found no concrete proof of any link. For instance, back in the 1980s, researchers added a variety of Coca-Cola products to sperm in an attempt to see if it reduced their swimming ability, but ultimately did not find enough evidence to support this.\nMore recently, researchers published a report in which they listed several reasons why drinking too much soda could potentially cause erectile dysfunction. For instance, they explain that high sugar intake could cause some of the blood vessels in the penis to become clogged up with fat, impeding blood flow and making it harder to get an erection.\nAs such, they conclude that there is a high probability of a connection between soft drinks and soft penises, though they can’t confirm this without conducting a long-term study.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital\nreduce a man’s sperm count by as much as thirty percent END"}

The president-elect is an unpredictable political force who could dramatically change U.S. priorities at home and abroad.\nHere's a list of 2017's biggest risks, according to WEF, Eurasia Group and Control Risks.\nAn inward turn for the U.S.?\nTrump has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense, promised to scrap free trade agreements and questioned U.S. involvement in conflicts abroad.\nTrump's approach amounts to a rejection of \"American exceptionalism,\" the idea that the U.S. should actively promote democracy, civil rights and the rule of law around the world, according to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group.\nBremmer said Trump sees international cooperation in purely transactional terms: \"If there's not an obvious, near-term benefit for the U.S. ... it's not something the U.S. should be doing.\"\nAn American retreat from the world stage is bound to cause problems for its allies.\n\"The fact that the country that has been the linchpin of the global order since [World War II] is no longer available for service, that is absolutely the top risk in the world today,\" added Bremmer.\nAngry voters\nWidening gaps between rich and poor, and old and young, are fueling feelings of resentment.\nWEF said that while inequality between countries has been decreasing over the past 30 years, inequality within many developed nations -- including the U.S. and Britain -- has risen. The group pointed to Brexit and Trump's election as clear signs of a backlash against the status quo.\n\"Rapid changes of attitudes in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation have led many voters -- particularly the older and less-educated ones -- to feel left behind in their own countries,\" the WEF said in its annual risk report.\nIn Europe, France, Germany and the Netherlands will all hold major elections in 2017. Populist and eurosceptic parties could make major gains, and further undermine the region's precarious political balance.\nChina - opportunity or risk?\nChina has a lot to worry about in 2017. Trump has threatened Beijing with punishing tariffs and even questioned the U.S. position that Taiwan is part of \"one China.\"\nExperts say the relationship between the world's two biggest economies could change radically in 2017.\nDespite real policy differences, the two powers have avoided major conflicts in the past in order to protect their crucial trade and investment relationship.\n\"As of January, when Trump takes the oath of office, the feeling is no longer mutual,\" wrote Andrew Gilholm and Michael Moran of the consultancy Control Risks.\nThe analysts said it's unclear how the relationship will play out should Trump implement the anti-China policies he promised during the campaign.\n\"Leaders in Beijing are vastly more experienced, but we have little precedent for how they may react if pushed and provoked by the U.S. on issues where China is most sensitive,\" Moran and Gilholm wrote.\nRussian disruption\nA reduced geopolitical role for the U.S. could further embolden Moscow to \"act as a rogue and disruptor,\" said Bremmer.\nAnd President Vladimir Putin won't be chastened by allegations that he ordered Russian intelligence agencies to disrupt U.S. elections.\n\"He'll hack away at the French and other upcoming European votes. And the West won't want or be able to muster a serious response -- Trump's not interested, and EU leaders are either too weak or tired of sanctions,\" Bremmer said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An inward turn for the U.S.?\nAngry voters\nChina - opportunity or risk?\nRussian disruption END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Where \"Kanye West\" is more popular than \"Jesus Christ\"\n\nArticle: Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, though, has West's embrace of the Son of God been as fervent as his last album, \"Yeezus,\" which title is a portmanteau of West's nickname (Yeezy) and Jesus. The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high / But I am a close high.\"\nWith Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist.\nTo do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison?\nThere are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesù cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.\nThere are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and 'Ye.)\nSince Jesus doesn't have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\":\nAccording to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.\nWhile West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year).\nSo, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.\nBut what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus.\nOnly looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states).\nWhen did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye?\nKanye West's top five days:\n1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his \"Blood on the Leaves\" performance at the VMAs\n2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she's pregnant with West's baby.\n3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi.\n4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album \"Yeezus.\"\n5) 6/21/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby's name: North West.\nJesus Christ's top five days:\n1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas.\n2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday\n3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday\n4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday\n5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George's Day\nJesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday.\nWhen you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don't actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller.\nHow much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions.\nSo what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown:\nIdiomatic: 22%\nLiteral: 70%\nOther Person's Name: 8%\nThis sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven't accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere.\nSo, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " original Tweets END"}

It's a region that's associated with emotions and plays \"a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal.\" It further responds to an individual when they lie. \nEach time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced.\n\"We speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency,\" the paper reads.\nIt further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught.

He went on to be a part of Britain's National Diving Squad for 12 years, and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.\nEventually he was picked up by an agency called Sports Promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for French Connection.\nAll of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. But how's he maintained it for all of these years?\nStatham ripped as fuck in Death Race. Credit: Universal Pictures\nWell, the 49-year-old, who has studied Wing Chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime. And by strict, I mean fucking strict; this is Jason Statham we're talking about, he's a no nonsense kind of bloke.\nStatham only eats 'good food', saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again. He also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon. If you eat carbs later in the day, it's harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories.\nIn an interview with Men's Health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs.\nFor lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, it's not going to sound too appealing.\n\"I'm certainly no vegan, but there's this little place down on Sunset that I'll go to, the California Vegan, and they do a really good steamed vegetable and brown rice,\" he said. \"You put that in your body and you feel good. Or try a nice miso soup. There's nothing better than that stuff.\"\nHe goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein. He specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad. The icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol.\nSo, unfortunately, you're not going to get as stacked as The Transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab.\nJason's workout plan is a different kettle of fish. The martial arts expert believes in never repeating the same workout as he feels you see more results from varying your exercises. Therefore it's hard to pinpoint a solid plan.\nhttp://lions.gt/mechanictrailer\nA photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on Jul 3, 2016 at 5:10am PDT\nA photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on\nAccording to BodyBuilding.com, the 49-year-old has two rules when it comes to hitting the gym: 1) \"Never repeat a workout - it is virtually impossible to go through a training plan without repeating the exercises but each and every workout would be varied.\n2) \"Take notes of everything - as you progress through the workouts, it is inevitable that you will get fitter, faster and stronger. Therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated.\"\nWhatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body.\nHe told BodyBuilding.com that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises. This will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training.\nThe Snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment. He told Men's Health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each. Anyone else out of breath just thinking about this?\nStatham's high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs.\nHe then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag. The workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down.\nFor a weight based high intensity workout, Statham's trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times.\nThe time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured. The times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase.\nOf the exercises, BodyBuilding.com says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmer's walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows.\nNo wonder he's fucking jacked.\nWords by Mark McGowan\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime END"}

That is until For decades rumors of the singer’s sexuality swirled, even as he filled arenas and his records sold millions of copies worldwide. That is until Univision reporter Fernando del Rincón asked Juan Gabriel point blank if he was gay during a televised interview in the early 2000s.\nThe journalist first quoted a Mexican historian who had commented on how the artist \"explored the feminine side\" when on stage. Juan Gabriel responded saying, \"Art is feminine... Look, if you’re handsome and young and beautiful, well, people are always going to say that you’re gay.\"\nWhen del Rincón asked if the singer was gay, Juan Gabriel laughed and questioned why he was so interested. Then he gave a simple answer: \"They say that what you can see you don’t ask, son.\"\nWhen the journalist said that what he saw was a successful singer. The artist responded with a perfect analysis of what truly matters:\nThat’s what’s most important because your worth isn’t based on the things that other people can hold against you.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This bot has saved users $250 million, and it's coming to Facebook messenger\n\nArticle: Late last year, just in time for Christmas shopping, Rachel Rhoads got a nice surprise. One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.\nRhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. \n\"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" \nGetting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the San Francisco startup’s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month. Digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.\nDigit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.\nDigit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger’s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they’re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.\nThe company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic.\nAlso on the product horizon is having Digit’s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. \nThere are hitches. Since Digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.\nAnother hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"\nBehavioral finance underlies much of Digit’s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.\n\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie’s Education Fund,' I’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.\nBloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit’s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.\n\"We want to make Digit understand more—not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, ‘Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?’ And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"\nThat kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?\" (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)\n(Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Digit END"}

Always setting the bar high for themselves and for future generations of bands with each album and each performance, the way that Skynyrd has shaped the way rock music is made is possibly one of the greatest parts of the legacy they forged on that baseball diamond a lifetime ago. Whether Ronnie Van Zant would have liked Guns N’Roses, we’ll never know – but somehow, we think he’d be mighty pleased to know that the legacy he helped build is positively impacting the music world and inspiring artists to stretch themselves to achieve something great!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Guns N’ Roses END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s who professional gamblers are betting will become president\n\nArticle: Online gambling might only be quasi-legal in the U.S., but that's not stopping offshore sites from letting people place their bets on who will be fighting for the Oval Office in November. And oddsmakers are pretty convinced at this point that it's going to come down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\nTrump is given a 71% chance of winning the Republican nomination, says the Election Betting Odds website. (Using data from online casino betfair.com , the site averages the current \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices to come up with the implied odds.)\nClinton is given an 87% chance of sealing the Democratic nomination by the site.\nShe also is favored to win the general election by 55%.\nBut what about the polls?\nThat's certainly better odds than either candidate is seeing in national political polls. An average of six polls from news organizations on Real Clear Politics shows Trump leading the Republican field with 33.2%. And among Democrats, Clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of Bernie Sanders.\nThere is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds. One actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters. The other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct.\nSo, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, it's worth noting that betfair isn't the only online gambling site that's predicting a strong Trump showing in the primary -- with Clinton winning a narrow victory.\nPaddyPower.com currently gives Trump 5/2 odds for winning the presidency. Clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8/11 odds. (Marco Rubio has 6/1 odds on that site, while Sanders is far back at 12/1.)\nPut in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on Clinton and she won, you'd see returns of $172.73. Take the odds for Trump and that $100 would become $350.\nBig bets on Clinton\nOddsShark, meanwhile, says data from Bovada indicates you might be better served to just hold onto your money if you're considering getting some skin in the political game. The odds for Clinton winning the Democratic nomination are so overwhelming that a $100 bet would just earn you an extra $10 and that same bet on Trump to take the Republican nomination would pocket you just $25 more.\nShould those two face off in November? A $100 bet for Clinton today would be worth $171.43, while a Trump victory would turn $100 into $260.\nScientific? Not even remotely close. But it does show what many people perceive will be the final ballot. And perception, especially in public forums, sometimes has a sneaky way of becoming reality.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Clinton END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This 28-year-old retired with a $2 million net worth. Here's how she's investing in 2017:\n\nArticle: In 2016, JP Livingston celebrated her 28th birthday. She also retired. Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. \nWith less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity.\nMaya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy?\nJP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities.\nMany financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX).\nThere are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market.\nSecondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not).\nKachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017?\nLivingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs.\nIncome-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays.\nI have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago).\nKachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities?\nLivingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that.\nKachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy?\nLivingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know.\nPeople get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people.\nSecond: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability.\nKachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them?\nLivingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things:\n1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ.\n2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information.\nMomentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion?\nKachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey?\nLivingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you.\nSay you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished.\nAt 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds.\nMore on Forbes: \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why You Shouldn't Scare Your Cat With a Cucumber\n\nArticle: You may have recently seen a viral video compilation of cats freaking out after they’ve been ambushed by a dastardly foe: the humble garden cucumber. In these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around.\nAccording to IFLScience, the cats’ fearful reactions—which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable—are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice. In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable. (Animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator.)\nHowever, National Geographic reports that your cat’s fright is more harmful than hilarious. While the cucumber isn’t stressful to you, it’s stressful to the cat. And since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone. In worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days.\nBottom line? Slowly introduce new toys and objects to your cat, as they’re a source of mental stimulation. Just don’t unexpectedly give it a cucumber—or for that matter, any other new item that might cause distress.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why J. K. Rowling Endorsed ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ for the Stage\n\nArticle: Jamie Parker You have abandonment issues, obviously.\nYou both share story credit with J. K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix?\nJohn Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, \"What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?\" I said, \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" There was something in her eye — I thought, we didn’t say it’s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we’re on the right track.\nThorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as a starting point.\nTiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.\nCallender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.\nThorne All right, I’m a nerd. With abandonment issues.\nDid you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting?\nThorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, \"This feels right, this doesn’t.\"\nTiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn’t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.\nFriedman That’s enough!\nWas the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning?\nTiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, \"Why not two parts?\" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It’s a cliffhanger.\nNoma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.\nHow is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel?\nThorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn’t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It’s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.\nTiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?\nDumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you’re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. I’m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, it’s something I’ve never experienced before.\nWhat about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can’t create the kind of effects that happen in film?\nTiffany Film has got green screen. We’ve got the imagination of the audience.\nHow do you feel, Jamie and Noma, playing characters that a huge fan-base feel so possessive about? Is it intimidating?\nDumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.]\nParker It’s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that.\nDumezweni The weight of expectation is huge. But for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione. Ultimately it’s a theater piece, I’m a theater actor and doing a job as best I can.\nHas it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? And what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online?\nCallender I’m hopeful after seeing how people were about \"Star Wars.\" They mostly protected the fans.\nTiffany It will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on July 30, so that it’s not our secret to keep. But if you don’t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we’ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge.\nParker And you don’t get that much nowadays. So often things are ruined because you know so much.\nDumezweni I’ve quite loved the secrecy. Although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. My daughter tries to guess what is in the play. She says, \"Just smile at me if I’m right.\"\nTiffany My mum is the only problem. Everyone else is fine. She asks really specific questions; then I discovered people are quizzing her in her local supermarket.\nParker When people ask, I just pull out a wand, and go, \"I’m a wizard!\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: What is the easiest way to quit smoking?\n\nArticle: What is the Easiest Way to Quit Smoking?\nMar 04, 2017\nWhat does Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and Ellen DeGeneras all have in common? They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits.\nResearchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey.\nA comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone.\nTypes of Addiction\nSmoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days.\nThe real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an automatic behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.\nHow Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit\nSo what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable  or unnecessary  to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market.\nBut going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hypnosis END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Guess how much money Bill Gross made last year? Exclusive by @ritholtz:\n\nArticle: How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.\nIn 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually.\nA Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\"\nSalmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion.\nSo how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).\nAnd the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco’s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny.\nThe top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.\nGross’s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.\nIn the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.\n* * *\nHow Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.\nIt has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer’s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.\nMuch of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco’s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm’s revenue.\nWe can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let’s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.\nPimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.\nWhen Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.\nThe bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz’ partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross’s financial and managerial judgment.\nThus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest.\nThis same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\"\n* * *\nPart of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.\nWhy? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)\nPimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays.\nBeyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management.\nFor one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money.\nIn the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.\nAnother item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive.\nIn a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\"\nBut while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door.\nHowever, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined.\nThe market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.\nPerhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.\nIf I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " $290 million END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The most life-affirming TV episode of the year came from the most unexpected place\n\nArticle: In a year of doom and gloom, Black Mirror offered the world a truly wonderful episode \nThere’s a reason people keep banging on about the Golden Age of TV. Just look at 2016: Atlanta, The People v OJ, Veep, The Night Of, Stranger Things, Westworld... the list of brilliant TV shows goes on. \nMany of the best - including the likes of Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, and The Walking Dead - took viewers down dark, emotional roads. The latter show, for instance, saw numerous popular characters killed off. The former saw an animated horse’s continued existential crises hit a new low. House of Cards offered another petrifying take on the political climate.\nOne show many consider to have a doom-mongering, pessimistic view of life is Black Mirror, the Channel 4 show picked up by Netflix. Season three offered some of the darkest episodes yet: just look at \"Shut Up and Dance\", centring on a young man being blackmailed into doing terrible tasks for a group of hackers, featuring a horrendous final twist.\nAmong those six new episodes, though, lies ‘San Junipero', a somewhat enigma when it comes to the series. Instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode’s writer - Charlie Brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. **Spoilers ahead**\nIn the episode, the wonderfully awkward Yorkie - played by Mackenzie Davis - falls helplessly in love with Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) while partying at the Californian beach resort San Junipero. This is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. How? Because San Junipero isn’t a real place: it’s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited. \nIt transpires that Yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in San Junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. Kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in San Junipero. \nEventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so Kelly can formerly authorise Yorkie’s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. Yorkie is then uploaded to San Junipero. Kelly, however, rejects Yorkie’s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to San Junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie.\nWritten down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. Yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. Is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant?\nWell, there’s one issue. As the episode finishes, there’s a lasting shot of the computer servers keeping Yorkie and Kelly’s consciousness ‘alive' - the ‘TCKR’ system. A reminder, that everything could be flicked off with the switch of a button/power outage. A haunting reminder to live every moment to the fullest.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Black Mirror's 'San Junipero': 2016's most life-affirming piece of television END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Ticking time bomb\n\nArticle: At December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, doctors described Type 2 diabetes as \"scarier than HIV and malaria,\" causing more deaths than either. But is society enabling the deadly killer?\nIt takes a seismic event to get a transglobal family together in one place. For mine, it was the death of my grandmother in Kerala.\nShe had been our collective anchor. My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar.\nUpon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. By the time I arrived in Calicut, at the house where I had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral.\nSomeone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. I made myself another two more.\nFollowing the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from America, asked me to take a walk with her. The oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home.\nCalicut, where I was born, is a city on India's south-west coast. I often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. There's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in India. Coconut trees line the streets, as the Arabian Sea sparkles to the west and the Wayanad hills rise in the east.\nDuring the 13th Century, Calicut became a major port for the Indian Ocean trade route. Merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the West.\nAnd as my aunt and I took our walk, we passed several street vendors. A man was pulping sugar canes into a drink.\nFeeling slightly light-headed, I was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye.\nOn the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that I had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up.\nIt had belonged to a tailor named Padmanabhan. He had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my family's fashion choices over the years.\nHe'd cut and shaped my aunt's wedding sari. And my cousin's. He'd made my school uniform. And my niece's and nephew's. He'd disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when I told him that people had asked if they were from Paris.\n\"He died,\" my aunt said, following my gaze.\n\"Of what, he was only in his 50s, wasn't he?\" I asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in Kansas.\n\"Type 2 diabetes. He had to have his leg amputated. So sad.\"\nThe international burden of diabetes is a much-told news story. New data from the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million people in the world have diabetes. By 2040, the figure is expected to grow to 642 million. That's an estimated one in 10 of the world population. Currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease.\nIndia has, until it was surpassed by China, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having Type 2 diabetes. And worryingly, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030.\nType 2 Diabetes\nDiabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high.\nAt December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, Dr Sanjay Kalra and his colleague Dr Ashok K Das delivered a speech where they called Type 2 diabetes \"a ticking time bomb for India\".\n'We need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts,\" Dr Kalra told me. \"HIV is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours. For diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life.\n\"Indian society frowns upon IV drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for TV).\"\nFollowing our interview, Dr Kalra contacted me via Whatsapp to offer a few extra facts.\nDid I know that 11 January 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in Toronto? And urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesn't discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds.\nAnd could I please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like Punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition.\nBack on the side of the road in Calicut, I looked at Padmanabhan's boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt. She smiled, and took my hand, like she had when I was a child, to walk me back to the house.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Type 2 diabetes END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Six of the last seven times this happened, stocks rose\n\nArticle: After three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring?\nIf history repeats, stocks could be in for a sweet end to the year. In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them — 2007 — did the index drop in the fourth.\nActually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data.\nThat 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain.\nThe recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality — or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness.\nBut for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly — creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes.\nSo will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend?\nUnfortunately, marshaling stats all day can obscure but can never alter the fact this question is patently unanswerable.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The seven simple money-saving hacks that could save you THOUSANDS a year\n\nArticle: Saving money can often mean cutting back on things you love - but these expert tips prove that doesn't need to be the case.\nThe surprisingly simple lifestyle hacks from Quidco can help you save thousands of pounds a year without sacrificing your lifestyle.\nFrom stockpiling discounted goods to buying coats in summer, some of the handy hints focus on savvier shopping habits.Others are as straightforward as asking big brands for a better deal.\nMoney expert Cathal Wogan, from Quidco, said: 'Many of us want to be able to count our savings in pounds rather than pennies but don't know where to start.\n'There's no magic to it we've picked out some secrets to help people buy better.  With smart shopping, those pounds can quickly add up to savings of thousands over the course of a year.' \nHere, FEMAIL rounds up the seven best tips... \nBUY CLOTHES OUT OF SEASON  \nIt might be hard to think of winter in spring, but planning ahead seasonally can help you save a bundle on clothes and shoes. \nA £100 winter coat could be down to £50 in spring as retailers clear stock, so thinking ahead to what you'll need in nine months time will reap major rewards. \nIf you can train yourself to think ahead to summer wear in the autumn, you'll see that the clearance sale prices can leave you with money in your pocket.\nSTOCKPILE WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT \nIf you see a good deal on something you'll use, it's often cost-effective to stockpile.  \nBuying more will therefore increase your savings in the long term as you use your discounted purchases even when that item goes back to its standard price.\nCathal explained: 'Take for example a family using two £1 tins of tomatoes in a big weekly pasta dish. That's £104 of tinned tomatoes, so stockpiling those tins when they're available at half price could put £52 back into the family finances every year. \n'You can do this with non-perishable food goods, but also other items like cleaning and personal hygiene products, which are regularly heavily discounted. Just make sure to do the maths.' \nASK FOR DISCOUNTS  \nIt might sound too good to be true, but you would be surprised how often you can get a discount if you just ask. \nThis is especially true with big-name chains like phone shops, and homewares and electricals outlets, where flexible discounting can often be part of their retail policies.   \nIn-store offers can help you save on your weekly shop, but your receipts could help you save hundreds of pounds too.\nApps such as ClickSnap feature grocery discounts and even freebies. It works by refunding the cost of certain goods after you upload a picture of your receipt, with dozens of different promotional offers every week.\nDON'T BE AFRAID TO PRAISE AND COMPLAIN \nCompanies love when the people who enjoy their products tell them about it. \nIf you just send a letter to the freepost address of the manufacturer, they will often send you goodies or vouchers to say thank you. The same goes for advocating for your favourite products and services on social media, as it's not unusual for them to get back to you to say thanks with some freebies. \nCHECK FOR A CASHBACK DEAL   \nOn top of discounts, there is a cashback deal to be found on nearly everything we buy online. If you shop through Quidco you can commonly get 5 per cent, 10 per cent or more in cashback on whatever you buy. With average annual savings of £305, it's a money-saving habit worth picking up. \nSTART A SAVINGS ACCOUNT  \nStarting a savings account can fall down the list of priorities for many of us because the returns might not immediately be huge. But very few people know how to get big cash bonuses when they start a savings account.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " BUY CLOTHES OUT OF SEASON\nSTOCKPILE WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT\nASK FOR DISCOUNTS\nDON'T BE AFRAID TO PRAISE AND COMPLAIN\nCHECK FOR A CASHBACK DEAL END"}

Thirty-six percent of respondents said that the relationship would be improved by more communication, while 34 percent said that it would make no difference. Another 10 percent said it would actually make things worse.\nAnd although more approved than disapproved of Obama's phone conversation with Rouhani, outlook on Obama's handling of Iran was more bleak.

But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent.\nOregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle.\nNPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk.\nWe could just eat less dairy and beef.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Brock Turner Is Not Actually A Rapist\n\nArticle: There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student Brock Turner , following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. A compelling, haunting description by the victim of her experience has been read millions of times online after being released by the district attorney – its power so at odds with the court’s apparent leniency.\nAround the world outraged headlines have referred to the \"Brock Turner rape case\". And that’s quite accurate – he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. But those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of DNA testing.\nAs such, the case continued on the basis of ‘lesser’ charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. In essence, Californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis. Since that did not occur Turner is a criminal, a sex offender – but he isn’t, according to the law, a rapist.\n  Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00  Fullscreen Playback Rate 1  Subtitles subtitles off  Captions captions settings\ncaptions settings captions off  Chapters Chapters  Mute 00:00  Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done  Close Share Video: Share via:  Facebook\n Google+\n Twitter\n tumblr\n Pinterest\n LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code:  Restart ‘Heroic’ Swedish student who stopped Stanford rape describes what he saw\nIt is notable that America’s Federal Bureau of Investigations defines rape differently, as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim\". That reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. California is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise ‘object penetration’ to a lesser degree than penile penetration.\nEven so, Turner’s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. Even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism.\nUnder English law, Turner wouldn’t be classified as a rapist either. As in California, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. That is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime.\n Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life  \n 19 show all   Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life\n  1/19 Afghanistan Recommendation: I urge the Government of Afghanistan to adopt legislative reforms to ensure that sexual violence offences are not conflated with adultery or \"morality crimes\" and to establish infrastructure for the delivery of protection, health and le gal services to survivors.

I encourage the authorities to implement Law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. Conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the Havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. Particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups.

Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, \"was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let’s do a sandwich restaurant. And that’s how 'Wichcraft was born,\" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain—which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall—thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar's knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC.\nTom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar.\nStill, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said.

Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don’t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\nIn 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom.\nNeither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.\nNow, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.\nCalifornia's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.\nThe Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.\n[Kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor]\nOther effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.\nWhile state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.\nThe shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.\nOn the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.\nThe poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.\nMeanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.\n[Bernie Sanders is right: The top 0.1 percent have as much as the bottom 90 percent]\nKansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.\n\"It’s remarkable,\" Chinn said.\nIt is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.\nStill, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average.\n[Will higher taxes on the rich derail California’s economic comeback?]\nFew, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth\nThe Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: You Won’t Believe the Food That Has Quickly Replaced Tobacco as The Most Popular Currency in US Prisons\n\nArticle: Ramen is one of the most popular foods in the country- it’s been having a major moment for years now. Every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. Now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in US prisons, The Guardian reports.\nAccording to a study done by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to US prisoners have made the food a commodity. And the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they’re worth. At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn’t change unless there’s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said.\nHe attributes ramen’s popularity to the fact that it’s \"easy to get\" and \"high in calories,\" something of value to people who \"spend their days working and exercising.\" They need the energy.\nRamen has been popular in prison for a long time. Gustavo \"Goose\" Alvarez who spent more than ten years in prison wrote a book about it called Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories From Behind Bars. It includes recipes that can be made with items available to prisoners, such as tamales \"Doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen,\" and celebrity ramen recipes.\nIt’s not all trading and food hacks, though. When something is valuable and being traded on a sort of black market, things can get tricky. At inmate stores, people often buy things on credit. When credit isn’t paid, it leads to problems. \"I’ve seen fights over ramen,\" said one inmate. \"People get killed over soup.\"\n[H/T The Guardian]\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ramen END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: And the richest state in the country is...\n\nArticle: From 24/7 Wall St.\nLast year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.\n\"The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year\" said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. \"We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.\"\nWhile the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.\nDespite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. \"We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\"\nStates with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.\nEmployment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.\nElise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. \"When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.\nUnemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.\nThe types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.\nAt the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.\n\"There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,\" Danziger said. \"Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.\"\nTo identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.\nHere are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Maryland END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: You probably know to ask yourself, \"What do I want?\" Here’s a way better question\n\nArticle: Everybody wants what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room.\nEveryone would like that—it’s easy to like that.\nIf I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it’s so ubiquitous that it doesn’t even mean anything.\nA more interesting question, a question that perhaps you’ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.\nEverybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence—but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blasé confines of an infinite cubicle hell. People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth.\nEverybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship—but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder \"What if?\" for years and years and until the question morphs from \"What if?\" into \"Was that it?\" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, \"What was that for?\" if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for?\nBecause happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life.\nAt the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. It’s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we’re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings.\nPeople want an amazing physique. But you don’t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions.\nPeople want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you don’t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not.\nPeople want a partner, a spouse. But you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It’s part of the game of love. You can’t win if you don’t play.\nWhat determines your success isn’t \"What do you want to enjoy?\" The question is, \"What pain do you want to sustain?\" The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.\nThere’s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, \"You’ve just got to want it enough!\"\nEverybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just aren’t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want \"enough.\"\nBecause if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand.\nIf you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn’t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don’t actually want it at all.\nSometimes I ask people, \"How do you choose to suffer?\" These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You can’t have a pain-free life. It can’t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately that’s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain?\nThat answer will actually get you somewhere. It’s the question that can change your life. It’s what makes me me and you you. It’s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together.\nFor most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician — a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if I’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Then ... and then nothing.\nDespite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. And it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: I didn’t actually want it.\nI was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I’m playing—but I wasn’t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all.\nThe daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit. The broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the top.\nOur culture would tell me that I’ve somehow failed myself, that I’m a quitter or a loser. Self-help would say that I either wasn’t courageous enough, determined enough or I didn’t believe in myself enough. The entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that I chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. I’d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something.\nBut the truth is far less interesting than that: I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn’t. End of story.\nI wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way.\nWho you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.\nThis is not a call for willpower or \"grit.\" This is not another admonishment of \"no pain, no gain.\"\nThis is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The secret reason so many men go to the gym\n\nArticle: For millions of men, going to the gym is a daily ritual. Their reasons may vary widely — from looking to lose weight to building muscle and getting chiseled. Some men even go to experience a place of solace; somewhere outside of the house and away from work where they can relax, hit the steam room, or just burn off some calories on the treadmill. But new research indicates there are actually body image issues at play driving more men to fitness centers than you might expect.\nBody image issues aren’t typically associated with men, though they are fairly widespread.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Are Shorter Work Days Better For Your Health &amp; Productivity?\n\nArticle: There are 120 hours in a 5-day workweek, and for most working Americans at least a third of that time is spent earning a living. Sure, you’ve got 16-ish hours away from the job each day, but is that enough time to enjoy all your personal, family, community, and social commitments without becoming a harried, frazzled unproductive mess? An ongoing study out of Sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity.\nBy knocking off 10 hours of work each week for a year, employees at a Swedish nursing home were able to improve their health, cut back on sick leave, and enhance the care of their charges, The New York Times reports.\nUnder the experiment, which focused on the future of work in Gothenburg, employees began working six-hour days at the same pay rate as their previous eight-hour days.\nOne employee says that after just one week he was more energized and residents said their standard of care had improved.\n\"What’s good is that we’re happy,\" one employee tells the Times. \"And a happy worker is a better worker.\"\nWhile workers reported feeling better about the jobs and their contribution, employers that took part in the experiment found a 30-hour work week sharply reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, enhanced creativity, and reduced turnover.\n\"We’ve had 40 years of a 40-hour workweek, and now we’re looking at a society with higher sick leave and early retirement,\" Daniel Bernmar, leader of the political party running the trial, said. \"We want a new discussion in Sweden about how work life should be to maintain a good welfare state for the next 40 years.\"\nThe owner of a start-up in Stockholm, which operates on a six-hour day but didn’t take part in the study, says the shorter days have assisted the small company to double its revenue and profit for the past three years.\n\"We thought doing a shorter workweek would mean we’d have to hire more, but it hasn’t resulted in that because everyone works more efficiently,\" the owner tells the Times. \"Since we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time.\"\nSahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg tried a similar trial last year. The hospital’s orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. But unlike the start-up, it had to hire 15 additional workers.\nWhile the trial initially cost the hospital an additional $123,000 a month, it reduced sick calls, and increased the efficiency of the healthcare workers.\nAlthough the tests have been helpful to both participating companies and employees, the concept hasn’t been greeted with open arms by everyone.\nSome opponents of the option contend that the country’s economy would suffer from reduced competitiveness and strained finances, the Times reports.\n\"We can’t pay people to not work,\" Maria Rydén, Gothenburg’s deputy mayor, who is working to put an end to the trial, tells the Times.\nIn Sweden, an Experiment Turns Shorter Workdays Into Bigger Gains [The New York Times]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An ongoing study out of Sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: [The Guardian] Why did Croatia fans disrupt their Euro 2016 match against Czech Republic?\n\nArticle: Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.Please install Adobe Flash TM and try again. Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.\nWhy would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? And why would they then start a fight among themselves?\nThey are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.\nThey claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation’s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation’s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case.\nLast year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs.\nMany fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair – as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet – and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long – and at the moment unsuccessful – campaign to have them removed via the legal system.\nCroatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday’s match.\nSome radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football.\nTheir aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this.\nAmong the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. Croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the Czech Republic . \"Maybe it would be best if we don’t play at all,\" said Ivan Perisic, who scored the opening goal for Croatia. \"Maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play.\"\nThe coach, Ante Cacic, added: \"We are all to blame. Let’s not start washing our hands from it.\"\nHe is right, nothing will be won by people in authority not taking control of this ugly situation. The fear, however, is that no one will give in: not the top people at CFF, nor the ultras who are so fed up with them.\nAnd, ultimately, the losers will be the players and the supporters who would love nothing more than having their national team back.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 3 Things To Know About the Future of Virtual Reality\n\nArticle: Delegates use the Gear VR (virtual reality) headset, manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co., at the Samsung Unpacked launch event ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016.\nStrap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That's the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\nAs impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. That's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo's Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.\nFew have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware's cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it's headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.\nVirtual reality will get more physical\nAnyone who's seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.\nBut what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.\n\"The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,\" Gonzalez said. \"And not just sitting down; if you're a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it's there, it's going to happen.\"\nIncorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells.\n\"Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,\" said Azor, also Alienware's fourth employee. \"Well that's just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.\"\nIt's unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift.\nVR is an industry-wide effort\nThe Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.\nAzor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.\n\"Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,\" he said. \"VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.\"\nA wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon\nThere are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that's wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance.\nIt's unlikely that we'll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn't advancing at the same pace as VR hardware.\n\"By the time we solve that, as an industry we're going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,\" Azor said. \"Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that's where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Virtual reality will get more physical\nVR is an industry-wide effort\nA wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could solve the biggest problem with air travel\n\nArticle: During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles.\nOne of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners.\nWhile the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers.\n\"The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue,\" Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview.\nCurrently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet.\n\"To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin,\" Emery added. \"It's a bit counterintuitive for most people.\"\nWhy does air pressure matter to passengers?​\nFor most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness.\nAll of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag.\nBut the reality is that jet lag is far more serious.\nThe very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet.\nIn a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote:\n\"Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness.\"\nIn 2015 Boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever\nThe study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called \"increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours\" of exposure.\n\"The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level,\" Emery said. \"So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.\"\nAt 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself.\nAccording to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system.\nWhy haven't we had this all along?\nThe Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet.\nHowever, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum.\n\"Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet,\" Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. \"In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level.\"\nIn addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners.\nAirplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane.\nHowever, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body.\n\"We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well,\" a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. \"We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude.\"\nThe Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the effect of jet lag\nincreased the air pressure inside the cabin END"}

Last month it promised that it’ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided.\nFast forward to now, only a few days after the game’s official launch, and it’s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of Overwatch players.\nAnyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program’s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard’s security.\nThat’s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you’ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.\nBlizzard’s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating.\nThe moral of this story is clear as day, and it’s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch. No matter how smart you think you are, it’ll only end in one result, and that’s getting banned not once, but possibly forever. And no, using a VPN might not be enough since many users have reported that Blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a VPN.\nThe only solution: play fair and do not cheat.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: He created a database to \"figure out what the government really does with the money.\" What he found surprised him\n\nArticle: Guess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It’s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.\nBut first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.\nWhen Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \"I don’t, quote, ‘have anything to do.’\"\nAs he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the Clippers — his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.\n\"But come on, doesn’t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\" Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.\nHer answer: \"A, it won’t, because there are things government doesn’t get to, and B, you’re missing it.\"\nMr. Ballmer replied, \"No, I’m not.\"\nThat conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \"figure out what the government really does with the money,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"What really happens?\"\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments.\nWant to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That’s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.\nMr. Ballmer calls it \"the equivalent of a 10-K for government,\" referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.\n\"You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I’d get their 10-K and read it,\" he told me in a recent interview in New York. \"It’s wonky, it’s this, it’s that, but it’s the greatest depth you’re going to get, and it’s accurate.\"\nIn an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer’s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.\n\"I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"People can disagree about what to do — I’m not going to tell people what to do.\" But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \"on common data sets that are believable.\"\nSo how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation’s data?\nBefore he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.\nHis first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \"My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\" he said. \"And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing.\"\nBut neither option led him to what he was looking for.\n\"You’ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"Because I’m a citizen, I don’t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what’s going on.\"\nWith an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.\n\"Let’s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\" he said. \"I’m happy to fund the damn thing.\"\nFor Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.\n\"I love this one!\" he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \"Don’t look, don’t look!\" He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.\n\"How many people work for government in the United States?\" he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \"Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\"\n\"Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’\" Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \"Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.\" And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.\n\"And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\" Mr. Ballmer continued. \"Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.\"\nSuddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.\n\"Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,\" Mr. Ballmer said.\nHis other big surprises?\n\"Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\" Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \"I mean it’s funny, but I didn’t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\"\nMr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data — which rebut his preconceptions — could change his own politics.\nAt one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \"If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they’re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn’t thought about them.\"\n\"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\"\nOne rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.\nFor example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \"You know it’s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\"\nThere is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \"along with other data, but not a total,\" he said. \"I can’t show it! I’m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can’t report the data.\"\nMr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.\n\"We’re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — I think of this as another,\" he said, referring to himself and his wife. \"I don’t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don’t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it’s a civic contribution more than anything else.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.\nMost of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded\n\"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The one strange trick that will make you live longer\n\nArticle: Meditating inside a beautiful stock-photo room filled with plants is just one health benefit not available to poor people. Photo via Getty\nReports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?\nIn that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live.\nHere's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities—big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\"\nFor the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\"\nThe obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\"\nThe places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.\nAny study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\"\nBut if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.\n\"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.\nSeen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Have a Bunch of Money END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The bizarre new way to eat eggs that has everyone going crazy\n\nArticle: Cured egg yolks are delicious—but strong. Because they're super salty, they're better used as condiment than as the main event. For an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs.\nCurrently, cured yolks aren't even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so you'll have to make your own. Even better if you're raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand. Fortunately, the process couldn't be easier. Here's how:\n1. Start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl. Mix well to combine. Place half the mixture in a small baking dish.\n2. Separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use. Carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture. (This photo shows the eggs before they were completely covered. You want them to be totally submerged in the salt-sugar mixture.) Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 days.\n3. Remove the egg yolks from the fridge after 4 days. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the salt-sugar mixture off of the egg yolks. Run the yolks under cold water to wash any of the remaining salt-sugar mixture off.\n4. Place the yolks on a paper towel to drain and pat off any excess water. Transfer the yolks to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake them at 150 degrees for 2 hours.\n5. At this point, the eggs yolks should be semi-firm and look sort of like dried apricots. Use them right away, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.\n*In case you missed the memo, egg yolks are totally good for you. They're packed with protein, vitamin D, and omega-3s. And even though egg yolks are high in cholesterol, for most people, consuming dietary cholesterol doesn't increase your blood cholesterol.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cured egg yolks END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Annoying Question No Mom Wants to Hear When She Goes on Vacation\n\nArticle: Last month, I left my three children for almost two full weeks to travel across Nicaragua with my stepmother and sister. The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\"\nIf I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them.\nWhy would anyone find this shocking?\nOK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track.\nMost Popular\nTruth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map.\nSo why the question?\nOur society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\"\nWhy are we accepting this as normal?\nMy husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well.\nThis is why I needed a vacation. Alone.\n\"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.\nI had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were.\nMy husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it.\nUpon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them.\nSo go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It's good for everyone. And I promise when you do, I will never ask you who is taking care of them. Because I will already know.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Who is watching your kids?\" END"}

A student of Cuba's Conservatory of Music, Cruz's career took off in 1950 when she joined La Sonora Matancera, one of Cuba's most prominent dance orchestras.\nThe singer left the island while on tour with La Sonora Matancera in 1960, shortly after the Cuban Revolution, and never returned. The Cuban government refused to let her visit the island to attend her father's funeral years later, according to The New York Times.\nIt was in the United States that Cruz would become an international icon and earn the moniker \"The Queen of Salsa,\" after launching a solo career with percussionist Tito Puente, and performing with the Fania All Stars in the 1970s. She became famous for her booming voice, energetic performances punctuated by her signature outbursts of \"azúcar!\" -- Spanish for \"sugar\" -- and her over-the-top dresses and wigs.\n\"It's as if the earth opened her mouth to talk and sing,\" Marvette Perez, curator of Latino history and culture at the National Museum of American History in Washington, told NPR in 2005.\nShe continued cutting records and performing as a solo artists well into her seventies, including the award-winning \"La Negra Tiene Tumbao\" in 2001. By the time of her death at 77 two years later, she had raked in 10 Grammys, honorary doctorates from Yale and the University of Miami, and a Smithsonian Lifetime Achievement Award.\nThe doodle won plaudits from Celia's dedicated fans, who took to Twitter to cheer the Internet mammoth's artwork.\nIt's Celia Cruz birthday and there's AZUCAR in the google page. — Arlene Davila (@arlenedavila1) October 21, 2013\nLoving this @Google doodle honoring Celia Cruz!

Exemplifying of a new generation of creative polymaths, the writer-filmmaker-artist has produced photos, directed films, written articles and screenplays, and published a critically acclaimed memoir, \"The Girl Who Fell to Earth.\"\nIn her memoir Al-Maria talks about being brought up between two vastly different cultures. Born to an American mother and a Qatari Bedouin father, she spent her childhood in the US before moving to Qatar. There, she experienced the intense and rapid technological and cultural development of the Gulf.\nStill from \"The Future was Desert Part II\" (2016) by Sophia Al-Maria\nWitnessing this evolution inspired her to coin the term \"Gulf Futurism,\" inspired by \"the idea that time travel had literally occurred in one generation [in Qatar], from a sort of pre-agrarian society -- at least in terms of Bedouin culture -- deep into hyper capitalism and consumerism,\" as Al-Maria describes it.\nTechno-pessimism\nMore than anything, Gulf Futurism is perhaps an investigation into some of the more negative aspects of a hyper-connected digital society that can sometimes be a lonely place -- a perspective Al-Maria describes as \"techno-pessimistic.\"\nBorn in 1983, she describes herself as an early digital native, part of the first crop of millennials.

This phenomenon of fervent consumerism also feeds into our perception of what constitutes a piece of art.\n\"The thing is that people's concept of art is still very much object based,\" she explains, \"So even with a video piece, people will expect there to be something to play it on.\"\nWhile much time is spent thinking of digital art as forward thinking and innovative, the cost of this innovation may be a reduced life span for the artworks, which have used the technological tools available to them in their time.\nAs Al-Maria puts it: \"There's planned obsolescence in the devices, so there's planned obsolescence in the art.\n\"There's so much work lost.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 5 essential investing moves for millennials\n\nArticle: If you believe recent reports from the web, you probably think Millennials are financial floozies, trading their retirement money for Venti lattes.\nThe reality is probably not that bad, but also not as click-worthy: Research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies indicates that nearly three-quarters of Millennials are saving for retirement and that we started doing so at an earlier age than previous generations. Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more.\nWhat we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place.\nHere are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties.\n1. Get an education\nAt least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks.\nThere are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. Morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites.\n2. Say hello to risk\nRisk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. There might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out.\nIn investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. Investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. Could you lose money and never collect that premium? Sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term. \nHistory illustrates this: A portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by Vanguard. A portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. To put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. At a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000.\nBut a 2015 study from BlackRock found that Millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. At today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. That $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. Factor in inflation   a force that Millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money.\n3. Take that risk through index funds\nAbout 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. At this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. The best way to do that is not by dumping your money into Apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds.\nThose funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. You can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of U.S. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified.\nYou can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in NerdWallet's piece on investing in your 20s.\n4. Put a lid on fees\nYou can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. What you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments.\nEvery dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. Keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. Most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. If an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another.\n5. Use a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k)\nContributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. But you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a Roth IRA (check Roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the Roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option.\nWhy choose a Roth? If your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. And because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement. To see how valuable that is, use a Roth IRA calculator.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. Get an education\n2. Say hello to risk\n3. Take that risk through index funds\n4. Put a lid on fees\n5.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Football star comes out as gay\n\nArticle: Former Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam, named a first-team All-American after the 2013 season, has publicly come out as gay. The college football standout is eligible for the 2014 NFL Draft and is poised to become the first active openly gay player in the league's history. He spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to The New York Times and ESPN on Sunday.\n\"I am an openly, proud gay man,\" Sam told ESPN.\nThe 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign.\n\"I understand how big this is,\" Sam told ESPN. \"It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.\"\nA 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted Southeastern Conference for the 2013 season, Sam made his announcement just two weeks before the NFL Scouting Combine begins on Feb. 22 in Indianapolis.\n\"We admire Michael Sam’s honesty & courage,\" the NFL said in a statement released on Sunday, via Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. \"Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in NFL.\"\nSam recounted for The New York Times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year.\n\"I looked in their eyes, and they just started shaking their heads -- like, finally, he came out,\" Sam said.\nAfter coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, Sam starred on the field as the Missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the Cotton Bowl. Given the type of year that Sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming NFL draft by ESPN Scouts Inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. With the NFL's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, Sam's draft position will be watched closely in May. Several unnamed NFL personnel members interviewed by Sports Illustrated after Sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock.\n\"I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet,\" an anonymous NFL player personnel assistant said, reported Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated. \"In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.\"\nThe general manager of one NFL team told Peter King of Sports Illustrated that he believed Sam would not even be drafted after coming out. Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster.\n\"By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.\"\nShould any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates.\n\"We’re really happy for Michael that he’s made the decision to announce this, and we’re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,\" Pinkel said in a statement. \"Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he’s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn’t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we’re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn’t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don’t think there’s any way he has the type of season he put together.\"\nOne of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter.\nShout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam. Though its old news to us its a Great move by a great guy. Wish u much success in the future! — Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014\nNever cared if Michael was gay... As long as he put that pass rush on the QB and made my job easier i didnt give a damn... — Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014\nSam had been planning on coming out publicly before the NFL Draft but he had initially intended for the news to break after the NFL Combine, according to Outsports' behind-the-scenes look at the announcement. His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality.\n\"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\"\nWanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.\nI want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! — Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014\nWhile Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.\n\"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.\"\nAlthough several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A.

Among Republicans, only 15 percent said that human activity is the primary cause of climate change, although a total of 53 percent said that humans are at least a contributing factor.\nThe poll finds that 28 percent of Americans think Typhoon Haiyan specifically was caused by climate change. Another 32 percent said it was not, and 41 percent said they weren't sure.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: NEW: How Trump won Florida\n\nArticle: With more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, Donald Trump carried a 140,000 vote lead in Florida. | Getty How Trump won Florida Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide.\nDonald Trump’s stunning win in Florida was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide on Tuesday: Despite losing big to Hillary Clinton in diverse, urban areas of south Florida, Trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past Republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters.\nWith nearly all precincts reporting,Trump carried a nearly insurmountable 134,000 vote lead – 1.4 percentage points -- leaving Democrats crushed and Trump’s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn’t come.\nStory Continued Below\n\"I am so proud of this team! MAGA!,\" Susie Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day \"tense and nerve wracking.\"\nDespite Hillary Clinton’s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula’s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton.\nThe ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail.\nIn early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed.\nTwo weeks ago during a meeting at Trump’s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott’s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.\nThe spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote \"ground game\" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida – his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate – and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment’s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously.\nBut even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton’s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls.\nBy Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day.\nAbout 1 p.m., one source with Clinton’s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties.\n\"By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,\" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. \"We felt pretty good.\"\nThe size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.\nBut turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump’s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent – far higher than recent elections – Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.\nClinton’s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes).\nTrump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor.\nOne of Trump’s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama’s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point.\n\"The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,\" Fabrizio said.\nTrump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m.\nBy 9:10 p.m., Trump’s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House.\n\"So goes Florida, so goes the country,\" said Florida’s senior senator, Bill Nelson. \"Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they’ll be voting for Hillary.\"\nNelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support.\nBut while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida’s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks – 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively.\nTrump’s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump’s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club.\n\"My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,\" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim – proven wrong in this instance by Trump – about the power of the Hispanic vote.\nFlorida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump.\nMost major surveys also showed Trump losing the state – including exit polls on Election Day.\n\"This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn’t measure,\" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump’s numbers. \"The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.\"\nIn myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom.\nTrump’s campaign initially didn’t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television – a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration.\n\"Trump didn’t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,\" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. \"But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he’ll win because of what’s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.\"\nThe Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore’s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state.\nBut the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen. Nelson’s team fears a showdown with Scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message.\nClinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: [Th Guardian] We shoppers aren’t to blame for food waste. Guess who is.\n\nArticle: L ast year, ast year, Tesco’s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you’re finding that figure hard to envisage, it’s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco’s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don’t publish their waste figures, but let’s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we’d already know all about it.\nTesco’s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain’s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.\nAfter deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco’s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.\nJust in case you aren’t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.\nBut a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man’s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can’t afford to eat good, fresh food. What’s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.\nWhen the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?\nOnce we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning\nFour decades on, it’s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that’s riddled with problems.\nOne such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.\nThere aren’t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I’d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.\nOur rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we’ll consume, rather than focusing on what’s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.\nIf the untouched remnants of last week’s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?\nBut sell-by dates – the progenitor of use by and best before – were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.\nUndoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.\nAnd don’t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we’re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. The bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin.\nBattalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. If we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " supermarkets END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How Stephen Hawking Has Lived So Long With ALS\n\nArticle: An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds\nEditor’s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nStephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.\nThe famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care.\nBut his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.\nBut like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.\nWhy has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.\nWhat is ALS—and is there more than one form of it?\nALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.\nIt's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.\nThere is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.\nThe other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.\nThose are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.\nOne of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.\nWhat has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?\nOne thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.\nLife expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.\nHas he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?\nJuvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.\nHe's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.\nHow frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?\nI would say probably less than a few percent.\nHow much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?\nIt's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.\nHawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?\nI don't believe that adds to longevity.\nALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments?\nBeginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.\nWhat does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?\nIt's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " juvenile-onset disorder END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Scientists accidentally discover a new color, and it's beautiful!\n\nArticle: Back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance. After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists’ brushes.\nThis burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200°C (2,000°F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\"\nThe findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment.\nHe added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\"\nSo, what’s so special about this blue?\nThis pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Additionally, unlike Prussian blue or Cobalt blue pigments, it doesn’t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic – that's always a plus. Not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light.\nSubramanian told Artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. The paint manufacturers Shepherd Color Company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of YInMn blue.\nHe added: \"Our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable.\"\n[H/T: Mental Floss]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"YInMn blue.\" END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Blocking this color light may help you sleep better\n\nArticle: The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well documented, and have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years -- with good reason. Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease.\nIn particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.\nResearch investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:\nPatients were sleeping more during the night.\nTheir sleep quality had improved.\nTheir levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.\nThe number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased.\nLens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:\nA study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.\nShift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.\nWhile nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night.\nThis area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:\nLimit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether.\nGet light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.\nIf you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.\nBeing aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " blue END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here's why summer in New York City smells so awful\n\nArticle: For travelers with the gleam of the Big Apple in their eye, nothing seems better than New York City in the summertime.\nRestaurants have outdoor seating, there are festivals all over town, and you don't have to worry about bringing your jacket to Top of the Rock.\nBut long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office.\nHere's why it's hard to escape the stench of the city in the heat of summer.\nNew York City has the highest population density in the US, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation’s melting pot, it’s bound to get smelly.\nA census conducted in July 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile. To put that into perspective, the US, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile. That much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away.\nWith such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced.\nAlthough residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, New York City doesn’t have any of its own landfills or incinerators. Garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the Hudson River to be incinerated in New Jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas.\nBut even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day.\nThe sheer amount of garbage isn’t the only problem. There also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city. Diesel trucks carry garbage out of Manhattan 7.8 million times each year. Let this sink in: That’s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and that's just for one city.\nAll this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues.\nYou may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day. Or how it is possible to smell a food cart from all the way down the street.\nIt turns out the combination of heat and humidity allow bacteria to grow faster and smells to travel further. Increasing temps mean molecules move faster, resulting in enzymes speeding up metabolism and cells quickly increasing in size. Heat is bacteria’s best friend.\nSo when you get stuck with one those incredibly humid days, smells become only more potent. The water in the air causes these odors to dissolve, trapping them longer than if it were a dry day outside.\nTo many, New York is the city of dreams, but you have to be willing to accept it for the good, the bad, and the smelly.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: He Heard Something Moving Inside This Dumpster... What He Found Inside? Astonishing!\n\nArticle: Investigating strange cries emanating from a West Virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie. Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there.\nJames was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera...\nRetired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds.\nRight away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before.\nAs to how they got stuck, James said, \"The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn’t reach the top to get back out.\" And that rare raccoon?\nHe didn't really look like like his family members—or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly?\nThe organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn't forget the real trouble at hand—these raccoons were stuck.\nThinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free—but that brought consequences.\nThe albino raccoon had been \"a well-kept secret\" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha's Park Police Department. And once James shared his pictures online, Officer Jones feared it would become the subject of the public's curious cameras...\n\"Now that the albino’s getting publicity,\" Rodney said, \"I figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park.\" And people searching for a wild animal—with a wild animal's instincts—can be trouble.\n\"We try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don’t try to feed them,\" he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. \"I'd really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone’s curiosity or stupidity.\"\nWorse, the albino raccoon's appearance can make it a \"prize\" in the eyes of some people. Something special that needs to be captured or owned. Such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in Georgia...\nFor part of her early life, Isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. Because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. Luckily, there was good news in store for her...\nThe Georgia Department of Natural Resources rescued Isis and delivered the raccoon to Maxine Rainey, below, director of the Georgia animal sanctuary, A New Hope. But both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause...\nUnderstandably, Isis was aggressive. Human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. \"Since she was described as so aggressive,\" Maxine said, \"we were just going to hold her for a couple of days.\" But then what?\nWhen Maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. No wonder she was aggressive. Maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal.\nShe sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should've been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. But amazingly, that didn't happen.\n\"I'd been going through some stuff in my personal life, Maxine said, \"and I was kind of having a sad day, so I...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand.\" From there, the raccoon's life only got better.\n\"She's so gentle,\" Maxine said. \"She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.\"\nFor a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha’s Park Police Department...\nPeople like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals—potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection. They're to be admired from afar!\nJames had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way. Hopefully others lucky enough to spot one of these beautiful beasts in nature take the same approach!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " albino raccoon END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die\n\nArticle: It's hard to look at BuzzFeed without being reminded of your mortality. The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can.\nIf you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:\nFirst, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.\nNext, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.\nOn Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet\nNext, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example—how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks.\nOther tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane.\nI repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks.\nHere is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:\nSome of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch—like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die—but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.\nI decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra.\nI whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.\nThe last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip—around 40 hours in total—and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that.\nIn conclusion—drumroll, please—I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years.\nI'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted.\nBut if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.\nThat said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?\nI'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1,448.7 days END"}

So many talented players, so many talented teams. When you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the Rams twice a year, you go against the Arizona Cardinals twice a year, that’s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week.

Where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year?\nThat’s not for me to worry about. All I care about is our team winning; that’s the only thing that matters. The rest will handle itself. That’s my only focus, man. All that stuff like I said, I just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like I said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen—how I get ready for the offseason, how I get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and Bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that.\nWhat did you make of the Hall of Fame Game being canceled?\nI think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. It always comes down to players’ safety.\nThere was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got Jimmy Graham last year. You guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and Jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. How come his numbers went down?\nUnfortunately, he didn’t get to play the whole season. Kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. So we’re looking forward to him being back out there on the field.

Our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams—you take it one day at a time.\nCongratulations on the marriage, how is the married life?\nIt’s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. She’s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. I’m just grateful for that.\nYour celebrity has reached new heights. From third-round pick out of college to a couple Super Bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league—so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself?\nAwh man, I don’t pay attention to any of that stuff. I’m just grateful I get to play the game of football.

Sales after the DLC brought about 10,000 euro above what we were usually selling without the DLC, and normalized in about 10 days.\"\nSponsored\n\"So if we were to judge things by those figures alone, we would have lost a big chunk of cash,\" they added. \"Working with a publisher was a huge saving grace here, as we did not carry the costs of the localization which the publisher invested in, to eventually regain from the box sales.

We stuck to our deadlines, used a faster service to do our shortened localization, and we released the MultiPrayer DLC during the Steam Summer Sale.

Free DLC can be good for players and developers, but developers have to be strategic about it.\n\"The Indie market is a tough one,\" they wrote. \"If like us, you have a small team, limited resources and a tight budget that simply cannot stretch to huge marketing campaigns, you need to think outside the box.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Do YOU have high cholesterol? Here are 5 foods to eat and avoid\n\nArticle: High fat, low fat, no carb, more carb: when it comes to getting information on eating to manage high blood cholesterol, confusion reigns.\nWe checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol. \nThe verdict? Good news first! Eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol.\nThe bad news? Discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called LDL). Eating less lowers it.\nDo you know your blood cholesterol level? If you don't, ask your GP to check it. Over a third of Australian adults have high cholesterol.\n1. Eat legumes \nLegumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels.\nThe most recent Australian Health Survey found fewer than one in five Australians ate them on the day of the survey.\nThe results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together. \nThe data showed LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day. \nThis is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans.\nPulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. They lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways. \nThe soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel.\nLegumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. This means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal.\n2. Eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads \nPlant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts. \nThey are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk.\nPlant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver. \nThis 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood.\nA review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol.\nThe type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important. \nA meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and LDL cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil.\n3. Eat nuts \nNuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary. \nIn a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for LDL.\nIt didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction. \nPeople with higher LDL cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement. \nOne caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kJ), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day.\n4. Use olive oil \nOlive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. Olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat.\nMore than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice.\nA review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised LDL (a type of LDL), with no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol.\nIn contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the Mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or Mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat). \nAfter 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls.\nIn a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks. \nResearchers found total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil.\nThe reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. Switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol.\n5. Avoid junk food \nIn our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols.\nBut the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods. \nThe benefits of making these changes? They lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure.\nA big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 51, 000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010). \nAfter four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'.\nThose who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk. You can check your diet quality using our Healthy Eating Quiz.\nWhen it comes to heart disease risk factors, get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked next time you see your GP.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Giant Whales Found Dead In Germany. You Won't Believe What Killed Them\n\nArticle: As of January 29th, just on the shores around the North Sea, sperm whales were found stranded in the shallow area that is not meant for marine wildlife.\nHowever, the details of the animals' necropsy that was released shows a very gruesome truth as to how the whales dyed to begin with. Scientists were very concerned and deeply disturbed as to what they found inside the unfortunate whales.\nWadden Sea National Park located in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. Clearly, with this much debris in a whales stomach, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. Having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish. The press release that was given fromlocated in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. Clearly, with this much debris in a, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. Having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish.\nSome people suggest that this is due to the whales thinking that the plastic items were food, like squid since that is a whales go to staple. People on the other hand, however, believe that this is what happens when humanity continues to disregard marine life as well as the overabundance of plastic that is now circulating all over our oceans.\nEnvironment minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Robert Habeck states:\n\"These findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. Animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs.\"\nI n addition to this statement, Nicola Hodgkins who is affiliated with Whale and Dolphin Conservation states:\n\"Although the large pieces will cause obvious problems and block the gut, we shouldn't dismiss the smaller bits that could cause a more chronic problem for all species of cetacean – not just those who suction feed.\"\nIt is very important thing to note that the young whales did not die due to the plastic in their stomachs. In fact, according to National Geographic, the whales had died due to heart failure. This was a consequence of them mistakenly swimming into the North Sea, most likely in search of squid, but then not being able to support the weight of their own body's in such shallow water. As an unfortunate result, the whales internal organs had collapsed.\nEven that being the truth, humanity still needs to address this situation as a major warning sign about how much pollution we are pouring into our oceans. Do not dismiss their deaths as if it were meant to be, because it certainly wasn't. These animals could have had longer lives without mistakenly consuming the extreme amounts of debris we keep giving our planet. End this horrible trend of pollution, help us turn the tides and clean our planet!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " plastic debris END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: New data reveals who's likely to get married more than once\n\nArticle: Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise. According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\"\n\"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\"\nLivingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others.\nAmong those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry.\nThere are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.)\nThe more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013.\n\"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said.\nYounger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two.\nOverall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again.\nAge wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position.\nA majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle.\nPrevious studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts.\nAnother interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy.\nBut don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux.\nWhile today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family.\n\"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before.

Flu season is here, and enterovirus D68 has spread to all but three states in the continental U.S.\nHandwashing can protect against both, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it's our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting.\nThe simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands.\nWhen researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC's recommendation for a 20-second scrub. Men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up.\n\"Men are less concerned about things,\" study author Carl P. Borchgrevink, an associate professor at Michigan State University, tells The Huffington Post. \"They're not as thoughtful and they don't like to be told what to do.\" Men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. \"Many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands,\" Borchgrevink says.\nMichael Sykes, founder of the humor site the International Center for Bathroom Etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs.\n\"Men don't have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing,\" he writes to HuffPost in an email.\nSeventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a \"non-washing event\" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by Bradley Corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products.

Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them.\n\"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can’t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\"\nSpeaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post)\nToday brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape.\nThe new NBC News/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. Even more crucially, Clinton is demolishing Trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say Clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say Trump does.\nBut note Trump’s numbers among Republicans on the temperament question:\nFewer than one in five Republicans believe Trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. (By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats say that about Clinton.) Now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply.\nBut this general finding shows up in other polls, too. A recent Washington Post/ABC News survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of Republicans agreed that Trump is \"not qualified to serve as president,\" while 74 percent said he is qualified. Among all adults, 61 percent said Trump is not qualified. Meanwhile, the Post/ABC poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of Republicans say Trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall Americans said the same. For Clinton, the percentages of Democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them.\nThis basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. It regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. While this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. And this core imbalance goes deeper: Only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party.\nTo be clear, Trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting Republican voters in the home stretch. It seems very likely to tighten. External events or new Clinton revelations could still shake things up. But the conventions are over, and the Clinton team — operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own — appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about Trump’s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job. With a healthy assist from Trump himself, of course.\n1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hillary Clinton’s campaign comes to an end View Photos Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Note: The poll also finds that Trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of women and 70 percent of white college graduates.\nThis once again suggests that Trump’s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in states that are supposed to be very close (as Virginia was in 2012).\n* QUOTE OF THE DAY, EVERYONE-HATES-TRUMP EDITION: The Post write-up of the new Virginia poll includes this gem from a Republican-leaning voter in the state:\nWalt Purnell, 71, a retired business executive from Ashburn, had hoped to vote for Jeb Bush — or John Kasich. Or Marco Rubio. Or Chris Christie. But Trump? No way. \"I think he’s a failure, I think he’s a fraud, I think he’s a con artist, I think he’s insane,\" Purnell said.\nHave we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on Trump’s fundamental unfitness for the job?\n* CLINTON OWNS THE AIRWAVES: Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and the First Read crew serve up these striking numbers:\nHillary Clinton’s campaign...has spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-Clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million. That’s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for Team Clinton. But in that same time frame, Donald Trump’s campaign still hasn’t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-Trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $12.4 million over the airwaves. That’s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending.\nIt’s another fundamental Trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch.\n* TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY SEND TROOPS TO MIDEAST: The New York Times makes a good point about Trump’s big foreign policy speech yesterday:\nThough Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication. The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates — along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law — would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.\nTrump’s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. It’s a scam.\n* TRUMP’S POLICY GIBBERISH: Trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. CNN analyst Peter Bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best:\nThis seems unworkable. For example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? Also, Trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem — would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...In short, Trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue.\nThe idea is really an effort to repackage Trump’s Muslim ban as somehow being in sync with American values.\n* TRUMP’S BIG LIE ABOUT ISIS: Trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that Obama policies were the chief cause of ISIS. Glenn Kessler corrects the record:\nThis is false and facile. The terror group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003....At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS.\nWhat’s always missing from Trump’s account is that Clinton was more hawkish than Obama was. Meanwhile, Kessler’s interview with author Joby Warrick explores all this in more detail.\n* TRUMP MAY COST GOP A GENERATION OF VOTERS: Trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters. Michael Gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences:\nYounger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as \"politically correct.\" They are less likely to believe in \"reverse discrimination\" and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudes....Young people understand the logo of the Republican nominee...as conveying a message of exclusion. These are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year. It is the way to lose a generation.\nNever Trump conservatives and Democrats both agree that the GOP’s nomination of Trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the GOP among a whole new generation.\n* CLINTON PREPARES FOR SLIME-FEST DEBATE: Politico’s Annie Karni reports that the Clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with Trump:\nThe person picked to be Hillary Clinton’s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of Vincent Foster, label her as a rapist’s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers....one of the key components of that prep...is finding a person who can stand in as Donald Trump during mock debates and launch personal attacks...that will make the real Trump look tame by comparison.\nC\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can’t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\" END"}

In other words, Clinton’s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling,. And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president – Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump – have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\"\nAs Rupert Neate explained for the Guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows \"companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state.\"\nIn fact, some have claimed — all revelations of Panamanian documents aside — the use of tax-friendly locations inside the U.S. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with Delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. Clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes.\n\"Some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere,\" Clinton \"We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America.\" Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO annual Constitutional Convention earlier this month.\nOh, the irony.\nAccording to Neate, a Clinton spokesman explained, \"ZFS [Holdings, LLC] was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\"\nWhy, if what the spokesman claims to be true, would Clinton bother using an address in Delaware?\nOf the 515 companies Trump officially registered with the Federal Election Commission, \"We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware,\" the billionaire told the Guardian, \"meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks.

The approximately 2,400-square-foot condominium, in a decidedly deluxe if architecturally nondescript full-service building and owned per property records by an investment banker who bought it in March 2005 for $2.45 million from retired Italian racecar driver Mauricio Flammini, has an open-plan layout that includes an unusually spacious and arguably space-wasting foyer with stone tile floor materials, smooth paneled walls and half a dozen small closets and storage cabinets. The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There’s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine. An open-tread switchback staircase ascends to a jail cell-sized lounge that opens to a 200-plus-square-foot private terrace with outdoor shower space and panoramic city views from the Empire State Building to north and the new World Trade Center in the south.\nOfficially, the penthouse has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and online marketing materials show one of the guest/family bedrooms has a custom-built Murphy bed and the other — labeled as a \"bedroom/library\" on the floor plan — has corner windows and floor-to-ceiling built-ins with low enclosed storage and open shelving. The master suite, set privately away from the other bedrooms and lined on at least two walls with stunning, matchbook pattern wood paneling, includes a dressing hall lined with wardrobes, a laundry closet with full-sized machines and a windowless bathroom with poured concrete two-sink vanity, ebony tiled walls, a heated towel rack and a glass-enclosed multi-head shower.\nThis is not the first high-priced New York City rental for the former \"Dawson’s Creek\" star who produced and co-starred in the recently released silver screen drama \"Mania Days\" and who will portray Jacqueline Kennedy in an upcoming TV miniseries (\"The Kennedys After Camelot\"). In or around August 2012 she moved out of the $30 million-plus Beverly Hills mansion she shared with her now ex-husband Tom Cruise and holed up with their preternaturally fashion forward toddler, Suri, in a $12,500 per month rental at the so-called Chelsea Mercantile, which afforded her a convenient back door entrance into the Whole Foods located on the building’s ground floor as well as direct access to a subterranean parking garage that allowed her to evade paparazzi and the Scientology flacks who were widely reported at the time to surveil her.\nLast summer the slim and stylish single mother, who may or may not be romantically involved with Jamie Foxx, returned to Los Angeles, where she shelled out $3.375 million for a nearly 6,000-square-foot six bedroom and 6.5 bathroom residence — listing details described it as a \"Grand European Manor\" — in a guard-gated and celeb-favored development in Calabasas.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Apple iPhone 7 has two nasty surprises\n\nArticle: Questions over supply remain and there is no doubt ’s new iPhones are already proving immensely popular. But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase...\n‘Great Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.\nNasty Surprise #1: Goodbye Sapphire?\nThe first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens:\nThe revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs’ scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire.\nHe concludes: \"we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire.\"\nAnd here’s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when/if the company responds.\nNote: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it’s possible sapphire is still used there.\nNasty Surprise #2: New Home Button, New Limitations\nThe controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by Myke Hurley, eagle eyed founder of RelayFM, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure.\nThis means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. As he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing.\nThat’s right, you get nothing. Hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves.\nThere are a couple of ways around this. Firstly you can invest in ‘touchscreen gloves’ which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that’s a bogus claim that these don’t work, but I’ve tried two pairs and they do).\nSecondly you can setup AssistiveTouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. Feel free to insert your joke of choice here.\nDesigned By Apple - For Apple?\nAll of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7’s biggest external changes and who they really help the most.\nFor example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iPhone design for Apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. But the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from iFixit illustrates below).\nI’m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. Personally a far bigger battery would’ve been top of my list.\nThen there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card.\nThis despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.\nYes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn’t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea...\n___\nMore On Forbes\nApple iOS 10 Has 25 Great Secret Features\nApple iOS 10.0.1: Should You Upgrade?\nApple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature\niPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference?\niPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " #1: Goodbye Sapphire?\n#2: New Home Button, New Limitations END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: A University Recognizes a Third Gender: Neutral\n\nArticle: Being a boy didn’t feel right, either: \"I had a couple months where I gave it a go. I tried to bind my chest with an Ace bandage every day. I wore some masculine clothes and told my friends to call me Emmett.\"\nNeither category applied. \"It felt not only like I was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what I was like for the rest of my life.\"\nGieselman began spending time at Outright Vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted. \"As soon as I learned about a genderqueer identity, I was like, ‘Oh! That’s the one!’\" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. \"Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.\"\nGieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" \"They\" has become an increasingly popular substitute for \"he\" or \"she\" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it.\nWhile colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender.\nThe university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips.\nFor years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.\nToday, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.\nActivists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today’s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.\nIn hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.\nCertainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian’s two-spirits or India’s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there. \"It’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.\nIdentifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.\n\"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.\nIt might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.\nOne key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.\nWhile in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\"\n\"I said, ‘Well, yeah, but only with Anita,’ \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner — 32 years and counting.) \"That’s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Café in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\"\nA decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer’s first act upon being installed as the center’s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.\nAmong the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn’t match someone’s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student’s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.\nMs. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university’s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students’ office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student’s self-respect — and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.\nBy 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student’s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.\n\"Students proposed ‘they/them’ pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, ‘You don’t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.’\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his/her.\"\nBowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.\nThe change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " University of Vermont END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 10 pieces of career advice that are as true today as they were in 1996\n\nArticle: In the summer of 1996 after my sophomore year of college, I started an internship at a nonprofit technology association in downtown Washington, D.C.\nUntil that point, I’d only worked in retail and had no idea what to expect. I asked my father and a professor for advice. Remarkably, 20 years later much of that guidance still resonates.\nDoors open based on who you know\nIn the late 90s, these were physical doors rather than virtual ones, but the concept is the same. When applying for a job or looking to connect with someone, name-dropping would increase your odds of getting a positive response. Today, although we have exponentially larger networks thanks to social media, deep, in-person relationships still provide the greatest networking benefit. \nAs you build your network of contacts, remember to follow up\nMeeting a contact once is a wasted opportunity unless you periodically remind him or her of who you are and take steps to grow the relationship over time. In the 90s, I was encouraged to send snail mail holiday cards to former bosses and colleagues, and even to pick up the phone occasionally. Twenty years later, it’s all about LinkedIn.\nIn a new situation, aim to assimilate\nCorporate culture used to be \"one-size-fits-all.\" If you worked in a business office in any city in the world, you were expected to behave professionally, adhere to hierarchies, and generally do what you were told without making waves. Individual company cultures may be more unique today (conservative versus liberal, strict versus playful) but the need to examine and then fit into a new culture – whatever it may be – remains.\nDress for the job you want\nLike business culture, business dress was once straightforward. Junior level professionals in the 90s could wear business casual, which consisted of khakis and polos for guys and slacks or skirts paired with nice blouses for women. However, by the time you reached a senior level, you were advised to take it up a notch with tailored suits and pricey shoes and accessories. Basing your appearance on that of the executives sent a very clear signal that you intended to climb the ladder quickly. And it still does – even if the executives in your company now wear jeans and Hollister tee-shirts.\nBe humble and willing to learn from any task\nIn the 90s, if your boss asked you to grab coffee or make copies, you did it with a smile. You understood that you were paid for the privilege of watching and learning as the higher-ups did the real work. Today, those with little experience may feel empowered to say no to grunt work, but that doesn’t mean refusal is a smart idea. Human nature hasn’t changed and humility will get you everywhere. \nSuccess is not about effort, it’s about visibility and value\nEarly in my career, I made the mistake of churning out work product that no one ever saw. I didn’t get ahead until I made sure my managers were aware of how my contributions were impacting the bottom line. Today’s emphasis on lean teams and productivity means that adding and communicating value is more important than ever.\nA bad attitude will break your reputation\nLosing your cool at work has always been frowned upon, and despite claims of a kinder, gentler 21st century workplace, it still is. And now, the stakes are higher because your epic in-office rant won’t just be a legend passed down from employee to employee. Instead, it could be taped on a phone and broadcast on social media for perpetuity. \nTake advantage of company-sponsored training opportunities\nThe concept that employees should \"skill up\" to remain competitive has been around for several decades, and in the last years of the 20th century, companies had dollars to spend on tuition reimbursement and courses like Dale Carnegie. In 2016, training opportunities are scarcer and more varied (online, in-person, etc.), but they should still be coveted. It’s only a matter of time before individuals will be responsible for 100 percent of their professional development.\nIf you want to keep a secret, don’t tell anyone\nWorkplace gossip has been a \"thing\" since biblical times, and in 1996, the chief concern was that if you told a colleague a secret or rumor in confidence, that individual would share it with someone else and it might be heard by the wrong person. Never has this advice been more critical than today, when, thanks to the speed and ease of digital communication, your secret WILL be heard by the wrong person – guaranteed.\nBe respectful of others’ time\nBack in the day, we arrived exactly on time for interviews. We asked politely for networking conversations and check-in meetings with our bosses that fit into a half hour slot in the day planner. When we thought people were busy then – filing paperwork, sending faxes, and leaving voicemails – we had no idea what we were in for. In 2016, people are so overscheduled and frazzled that they take their iPhones to the bathroom. If you make them wait, they might just lose it.s\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Doors open based on who you know\nAs you build your network of contacts, remember to follow up\nIn a new situation, aim to assimilate\nDress for the job you want\nBe humble and willing to learn from any task END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Back to jail\n\nArticle: It is 20 years since Bolivia's chaotic San Pedro Prison became a tourist attraction, a place where backpackers stayed for weeks and partied with inmates.\nThe story was immortalised in a best-selling book, Marching Powder, and now the book's protagonist - a former inmate - and author have reunited to return to the prison for a new documentary film.\nThe inmate, Thomas McFadden, says returning to his old cell scared him. \"But I always wanted to go back to Bolivia, and there was always a strong connection between me and Rusty.\"\nRusty Young wrote Marching Powder in his twenties, when as a young backpacker from Sydney, Australia, he stayed in the prison, and later helped secure Mr McFadden's release by posing as an international human rights lawyer.\nIt all began when Mr McFadden, a British-Tanzanian, was caught smuggling cocaine in La Paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison.\nPrisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate. There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory.\n\"I thought what is this place? I even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there,\" Thomas McFadden remembers today.\nAfter his release in 2000, he left those days far behind and is now a chicken farmer in Tanzania. However, his life-changing friendship with his \"brother Rusty\" has gone the distance, and he has even named one of his children after him.\nTheir unusual relationship began when Mr Young joined one of the illegal prison tours that the inmate ran for foreign backpackers from early 1997 until his release.\nWord had spread around local hostels that there was an English-speaking inmate who would show visitors around this strange microcosm.\nCentrally located in downtown La Paz, the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in Lonely Planet guidebooks. Travellers paid an entrance fee and, in some cases, opted to stay for weeks, partying with the inmates.\nLydia Docking, a British traveller, went on not just one but repeated trips to the prison in 2008, led by a prisoner from Portugal. One of the other backpackers she met on her first day there later became her husband.\n\"As a conversation starter, we used to say we met in a Bolivian jail,\" she says from her new home in Sydney. She was 24 at the time and is 33 now.\nTheir San Pedro tour guide came to their wedding after his release, and although the couple has since separated, she still has their dog, named Pedro after the prison.\nDespite her jokes, she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story. \"I'm still confused by it, still processing it,\" she says. \"Over the course of three weeks, we went most days. I sometimes question why. It was mostly just to share experiences and to understand how lives start the same but can take such different paths.\"\nSan Pedro Prison remains operational today, despite many plans to close it. For years, its tours were an open secret, but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside. While waiting in the plaza outside, the cameramen caught a steady stream of tourists going in.\nArmed with the footage, the Bolivian press ran with the story. The main concern locally was not the tourists but the alleged corruption of the authorities, who were thought to be taking a cut of the tours' profits. \"Who is watching the police?\" asked an editorial in La Razon newspaper. During the ensuing \"clean-up\", prisoners had their visitors' rights revoked for a day. A riot followed and around 80 children were evacuated.\nIn 2013, the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12-year-old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail, after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men. Child welfare charities called for a ban on children living inside.\nLarge-scale tours of the prison are no longer possible. Today backpackers typically opt for La Paz walking tours, which stop outside the prison walls and tell Marching Powder's story.\nWhen Rusty Young and Thomas McFadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary Wildlands, they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them, incognito.\n\"They kept making factual errors, so I couldn't help asking smart-arsed questions,\" says Mr Young. Eventually an Irish traveller, who had just read the book, recognised the pair. \"He whispered, 'You're Rusty, You're Thomas!' And we sneaked off together for a beer.\"\nBack in 2000, the two men travelled to Colombia, after Mr McFadden's release. They found work as English teachers and worked on the book, which became a New York Times best-seller.\nThomas then moved to Tanzania, and Rusty went back to Australia, where after the huge success of Marching Powder he had difficult-second-book syndrome. His novel Colombiano, about a teenager who gets drawn into a Colombian terrorist organisation, is due out later this year.\nThe documentary Wildlands uses their story in San Pedro Prison as a launch pad for exploring all sides of the drugs trade, and includes interviews with former undercover US police agents and an assassin who was a right-hand man to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.\nBut the long-awaited Marching Powder feature film may still be years away. The rights were acquired by Brad Pitt's production company but have since expired. Narcos director Jose Padilha has been linked to the screenplay, and Don Cheadle and then Chiwetel Ejiofor expressed interest in playing Thomas McFadden, but filming never got off the ground.\nAs for the sequel to the book, perhaps that will come sooner. \"My publishers been harassing me about that for years,\" says Rusty. \"We already have a title: Marching On.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bolivia's chaotic San Pedro Prison became a tourist attraction, a place where backpackers stayed for weeks and partied with inmates END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: \"Pluto’s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn't » Second Nexus\n\nArticle: The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.\nFinding a Dark Moon\nUntil this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"\nMakemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.\nMK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.\nPart of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he\nthought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There’s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they’d made a major discovery.\nThe Moon in the Data\nIt is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.\nHowever, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.\nThe New, Improved Makemake System\nWhile MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an\nopportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" \nMakemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto’s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.\nLooking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " a charcoal-black moon END"}

Where will it be set? Even though GTA 5 is still doing well online. It’s forward that Rockstar will be looking.\nThere’s been a few inklings so far. To name one, could Tokyo by the next blueprint for Rockstar’s series? Maybe. Here’s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be.\nThere’s also been a lot of rumours that Rockstar has abandoned development work on GTA 6 to focus more on Grand Theft Auto online but it’s a given that the game will eventually come out.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean there isn’t any talk about where the next GTA game might take place. We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment.\nTokyo:\nAs mentioned above, Tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime GTA location. With it’s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. A good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older GTA 5.\nIt would also make sense in a story-sense as Tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the Yakuza. But is this too similar to the Hong Kong of Sleeping Dogs? Even though that was set in China, it does seem aesthetically alike. It would still be an interesting shift from West to East, however.\nChicago:\nJohn Dillinger. Al Capone. Frankie Yale. The Windy City is known for its mirrored giant Bean sculpture as much as its violent past. Chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a GTA game.\nEspecially in an updated fashion. It would also make sense being set in the U.S itself as GTA has also been a great parody of America as a country.\nLondon:\nIt wouldn’t be new to the GTA series, but it would make more a welcome return. It would also make sense to go back in time like Vice City did. If GTA returns to London, it would most likely be that of a different era.\nLondon would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the U.K and EU.\nWhere do you think the next GTA should be set?

Doctors Couldn't Find A Reason, Until She Found It Herself\n\nArticle: The one thing any teen doesn’t want to have happen to them is rapid, unexplained weight gain.\nBut Lizzie Denison-Ward, a now 20-year-old girl, had this happen to her for two years. She told the Daily Mail her story.\nShe started gaining weight in November 2013. She couldn’t tell why, since she had always been slender. She went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years.\nWhen she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories.\nSo she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. Not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face.\nShe decided to do some private research. And when she paid for an MRI scan herself after doctors wouldn’t help her, she found that there was a 4 mm tumor in her brain.\nThe tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing's disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her.\nBy the time she had the MRI, she had gone up ten dress sizes.\nLizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn’t without psychological cost.\n\"I believed the doctors after I first saw them,\" said Lizzie, \"but over time I thought there was something else wrong because I’ve always been thin.\"\nHer mother worried about her too.\nShe kept seeing her doctor, but to no avail. \"No one could get to the bottom of it and find out what it was.

No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too!\nPop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler! Check out the short but informative men's hair tutorial of achieving the most popular hairstyle in America.H/T - GQ\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " basically the 'undercut,' END"}

The main reason of excitement for this new AAA game is the setting.\nUnlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, Battlefield 1 is set during World War I. This will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective.\nAlthough we are all excited about Battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game’s setting didn’t get rejected. While speaking at the Investors Day event, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by EA.\nThe thing that Andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for World War I, it wasn’t the most obvious choice. If you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they’re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of World War I, I absolutely rejected it.\"\nHowever, things changed after DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. This convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time.\nI said , World War I is trench warfare, it can’t be fun to play.’ But anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path\nSoderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for Battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company’s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1.\nThe good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there. I think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for EA.\"\nBattlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the Call of Duty franchise from the number 1 position.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This CEO's first job? A Hooters girl\n\nArticle: Some successful people always knew what they wanted to do and had a plan. From a young age, they methodically plotted their way up the ladder. You look at their career path, and where they started — and where they ended — makes total sense.\nThere are many people who have become wildly successful whose careers had unexpected, even weird starts. They may have stumbled onto their vocations. Or they always had a passion — but found a very unorthodox way of finding their routes to achieving their dreams.\nTake Jonathan Goldsmith, the actor who plays the \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" character in commercials for Dos Equis. After first moving to Los Angeles, he worked on a garbage truck, according to an NPR interview. He lied his way into westerns, pretending to know how to ride a horse, and eventually played villains, even though he had always wanted to do comedy. He finally got a chance, decades after starting acting and while trying to refresh his movie career by auditioning for a commercial by imitating his sailing buddy, Fernando Lamas.\n\"It only took 50 years,\" Goldsmith said. \"An overnight success.\"\nEven CEOs and power brokers have had unconventional starts. Andrew Carnegie’s first job was as a 13-year-old textile worker. John D. Rockefeller was an accountant. Tim Armstrong, AOL’s CEO before the acquisition by Verizon, was a teacher.\nSo, if you’re one of the millions of newly-minted college graduates not sure of what’s next– or the parent of one — take heart. There are many paths to business in success. Here are some of the more unusual stories of people who started in non-traditional beginnings and yet rose to high-profile positions that brought them wealth and fame.\nKat Cole\nPosition: CEO of Cinnabon\nUnusual start: Hooters girl\nAs a teenager, she wanted to be a corporate lawyer and needed to save for college. So, at age 17, she became a hostess at a local Hooters and then, when she turned 18, a waitress — a Hooters girl. But she was a go-getter and by 19 was asked by the company to travel to different countries to help open foreign markets.\nAt 23, she was in charge of global training for employees and managers. She never finished the bachelor’s degree, although eventually she got her MBA. \"I was lucky that Hooters wasn’t a more sophisticated company, because there’s no way someone my age would have had those chances,\" she said. \"It wasn’t like people graduating from Ivy League schools were dying to get a corporate job at Hooters.\"\nRichard Branson\nPosition: Founder and Chairman, Virgin Group\nUnusual Start: Hit record producer\nBranson started a magazine when he was only 16, but really set off his career as an entrepreneur at 22 when he opened a recording studio and brought in singer Mike Oldfield. The result was a single called \"Tubular Bells,\" which stayed on the U.K. charts for close to five years. \"On the back of that, we built a record company, and one thing led to another,\" he told BusinessInsider.\nMark Cuban\nPosition: Owner, Dallas Mavericks, Co-owner, Wagner/Cuban Companies, Chairman and CEO of AXS tv, investor\nUnusual Start: Disco dancing instructor\nMark Cuban was an entrepreneur from his early years, when he sold garbage bags to pay for basketball shoes when he was 12. He started a number of businesses when a student at Indiana University, but the most colorful had to be teaching disco dancing. \"If you get asked by a bunch of sorority girls to come to a sorority house to teach girls how to dance for $25 an hour, you do it,\" he told the Wall Street Journal.\nSteve Jobs\nPosition: Late CEO, Apple\nUnusual Start: Selling illegal telephone hacking equipment\nIn the 1970s, telephone systems were far different than today. They used tone signals to control long-distance dialing. Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. \"If it hadn’t been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,\" he said in a 1994 video interview. \"I’m 100 percent sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.\"\nLes Moonves\nPosition: CEO, CBS\nUnusual Start: Acting\nBefore he got into the production end of the business, Moonves was a struggling actor in New York. After playing a few small tough guy rolls in such series as the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"Cannon,\" he gave up acting and switched careers. \"I was mediocre,\" he told Fortune.\nSumner Redstone\nPosition:  Chairman, Viacom and CBS\nUnusual Start: Spy\nDuring the Second World War, Redstone was part of an intelligence unit responsible for breaking the communications codes of the Japanese, which meant learning the language and culture. \"The work was so intensive that at some point I knew the meaning of more Japanese [pictogram] characters than the average Japanese on the street,\" he wrote in his 2001 biography, A Passion to Win. \"Breaking the Japanese code was one of the turning points of the war and I was proud to have made a small contribution to the effort.\"\nHowever, he found it \"tragic and unfair\" that Japanese-American citizens, most of whom \"must have been extremely loyal citizens,\" were not allowed in the facilities, which also slowed progress.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Kat Cole END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Research Reveals Indian Men Are Becoming Infertile. Here's Why!\n\nArticle: Infertility is no longer seen only in women. With the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days.\nA renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men.\nStudies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction.\nSome of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, Dr. Ved Prakash.\nBut dear men, worry not! There is a solution to every problem. And while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it’s not the only one. IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. Nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting IVF centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child. However, the treatments aren’t very budget-friendly. The minimum a couple spends on this is Rs. 1 lakh, which could be a matter of concern to a lot of individuals.\nIt’s okay to believe in the concept of YOLO, but what’s the point if it’s not going to give you all the happiness you need to live happily?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs END"}

The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton’s advocacy for children.\nIt is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district.\nThe second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska.\nThe district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district’s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters.\nThe electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon—or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright.\nIt’s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural.\nClinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s.\nThese are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Donald Trump just made an extremely important promise. It’s one of his worst yet.\n\nArticle: THE MORNING PLUM:\nBelieve it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications.\nThe near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.\nTo get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.\nTrump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.\nAs I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.\nThis deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.\nSanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:\nClimate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016\nAnd:\nAs a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016\nIt’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.\nIt is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: These extraordinary holiday trips will be the highlight of your year:\n\nArticle: One clear travel trend this year is that more Asians are becoming free independent travelers (FIT), eschewing the ordinariness of coach travel for the novelty  and bragging rights  of new places and experiences.\nHere are five extraordinary trips for them to make this holiday season.\n1. Adventurous Christmas: Chile\nTorres del Paine, one of Chile's wondrous sights. Photo credit: Shutterstock.\nThe sights are stupendous and varied: sand dunes, salt lakes, towering peaks, glaciers, geysers, lakes. Chile has it all in vivid colors.\nUse the capital Santiago as a hub and fly to hot spots like the Atacama Desert in the north, Patagonia in the south, or the mysterious Easter Island, famous for its nearly 900 monumental human figures with oversized heads carved right out of a volcanic mountain, then transported to different parts of the island  a gargantuan feat for mere humans.\nAnother highlight of a Chile trip, especially for avid hikers, is a 19km hike to the base of Torres del Paine (Towers of Paine) to view the three 2,000-meter granite towers in all their splendor, a sight guaranteed to floor anyone.\nChileans are friendly and hosts at heart. The best time to visit is November to early March, so it's perfect for the holiday season.\nWhere to stay: Awasi Atacama.\n2. Premium Christmas: Switzerland\nCar-free Zermatt (Canton Valais). Photo credit: Switzerland Tourism//Christof Sonderegger.\nFor a holiday as rich as Christmas pudding, Switzerland is hard to beat. Think spellbinding street lights and snowy villages, where the only problem you face is too much choice of where to go. Though it's small, Switzerland is multifaceted with a variety of history and traditions.\nFor cities, Zurich has the largest indoor Christmas market in Europe (until Christmas Eve) in the main hall of the Central Station where you can gorge on local treats from 160 stalls while your eyes feast on a Christmas tree decorated with 10,000 Swarovski crystals. Other highlights include a unique singing tree in town (come closer to the tree and you'll see it is actually filled with children singing Christmas songs) and the release of 800 floating candles into the River Limmat on December 22.\nThen head to Zermatt for an alpine experience. It's car-free, leaving the snow-covered streets gorgeously illuminated for the holidays. And the Matterhorn never fails to mesmerize. There also aren't any large crowds at this time, making this a sublime place to have a Silent Night, Holy Night moment filled with love and gratitude.\nWhere to stay: The Dolder Grand (Zurich); Le Petit Cervin or the Bellerive (Zermatt).\n3. Christmas in Santa's home: Finland\nNorthern Lights, Finland. Photo credit: Visit Finland.\nEveryone knowns Santa lives in Finnish Lapland and it's time you pay him a visit for all those times he came to your house. At least that's according to Visit Finland, Finland's official tourism promoter which, together with Finnair, has been recently courting Asian visitors  to visit the country.\nLapland, the largest and northernmost region of Finland, has 190,000 reindeers, 749 mountains and one Santa Claus. While there is a Santa's Village there, this amusement park may be too commercialized for some. Best to check out hotels and resorts that offer a more authentic experience where the highlights can include visits to husky and reindeer farms, hunts for the Northern Lights with a guide, snow mobile safaris and winter fishing.\nFinland will mark its 100th year of independence next year and to mark the occasion, Visit Finland has launched a StopOver Finland initiative comprising 50 easily reachable packages/services lasting five hours to five days. It's also worth mentioning that Finland is the shortest connection between Europe and Asia, giving you even more reason to make the comparatively short trip.\nExperiences available to Asian tourists include running tours of Helsinki, a two-day package to see the Northern Lights and a one-day trip incorporating two capital cities, Tallinn and Helsinki.\n4. Christmas-at-sea: Genting Dream\nParty all night at Zouk on board Genting Dream. Photo credit: Dream Cruises.\nIf you're after something different, why not eschew your boarding pass for a spot on a cruise? Hop onto Genting Dream, the first cruise ship of Asia's first luxury cruise line, Dream Cruises. It sails out from Hong Kong or Guangzhou in the south of China, and takes you to scenic destinations in Vietnam including Ha Long Bay and Danang.\nAs with all firsts, it's out to impress so you can expect keen service and a sparkling new vessel with such a wide range of facilities and entertainment it could be considered a destination on its own. This includes a waterslide park, Zouk nightclub (famous for its Singapore and Kuala Lumpur locations), more than 35 restaurant and bar concepts, the first Penfolds flagship wine vault at sea and a Dreamscapes enrichment program that will offer talks and presentations from esteemed speakers. Joining the cruise on December 10, for instance, is American astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, who will deliver a three-part lecture.\n5. Break the bank Christmas: The Maldives\nA Garden Villa at Cheval Blanc, Randheli. Photo credit: Cheval Blanc, Randheli.\nThe best time to visit the Maldives is from the second half of December to April, making it another destination pick that's perfect for the holiday season.\nIf you've been rewarded with a bonus as fat as Santa himself, treat yourself to a stay at Cheval Blanc Randheli. Owned by LVMH, it's one of the most stylish resorts in the Maldives with its contemporary minimalist design (by architect Jean Michel-Gathy), spaciousness (not just the size of the room; the resort's spa occupies another whole adjacent island), and extensive facilities to suit any tastes or needs (you have your own majordome for the entire stay who caters to your likes/dislikes and ensures your day runs just as you wish).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: He Went To Rip Weeds From His Lawn. Hours Later He’s Dead. You Could Be Next. BE WARNED...\n\nArticle: It is not uncommon to hear about somebody being stung by a bee or a wasp of some sort, as such type of insects and little bugs are very common in the outdoors.\nWhile getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung. Yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do.\nThat is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly.\nOne man from Tampa, Florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn.\nJohn Clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him.\nJohn got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment.\nHi wife went and grabbed John an ice pack to help reduce the swelling, and John sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful stings that were attacking his body.\nSoon after getting stung though, John started acting strange. He started experiencing numbness, and had difficulty breathing. Something was evidently not right.\nIt was only an hour after getting stung when John was gasping for air and told his wife three last words, \"I love you\" before he took his last breath and died. Doctors did everything they could to get his system back up and running, but to no avail.\nThis was the case of a severe allergic reaction that John had experienced called anaphylaxis. This type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like John was stung by, but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to its stealth.\nMany people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting, and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime. It is important to get tested for this type of reaction if you are going to be spending time outdoors or doing yard work.\nYou never know when you might get stung by a bee, even if it’s just doing the front garden like John was.\nA simple way to prevent the severe and deadly reaction is with an EpiPen which injects a measured dose of epinephrine into your body to stop the reaction, but it must be taken in a very short time window after being stung.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " allergic reaction from a wasp like John was stung by END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Dish You Should Never Order in Rome\n\nArticle: When it comes to dining in Rome, there's a pasta dish to avoid—unless you know the one place to try it.\nThere seems to be molto confusion around the origins of fettuccine Alfredo. Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes—not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.\nBut it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now—loaded with cream, often with chicken—is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't).\nShould we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you’ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won’t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers. Which, in Rome, is rewarding in its own right.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " fettuccine Alfredo END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty\n\nArticle: Here’s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty\nMargaret Osuma Oshien from Siaya, Kenya — A person who received just under $1,000 cash unconditionally from GiveDirectly.org\nMy wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving. From handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in Manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural South Africa — we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. When we found GiveDirectly in November 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. Unconditional — they can do anything they want with it — which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in ‘the west’ think it’s risky...or even foolish.\nWe’ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as \"eh, I only give people food,\" and others such as;\n\"How do they make sure people aren’t defrauding them or stealing the cash?\"\n\"I bet most people waste or squander the cash.\"\n\"It probably doesn’t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.\"\n\"General angst about the \"Savior Barbie\" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a self-serving endeavor.\"\n...and more.\nAfter dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers — and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD’s operation.\nOutside of GiveDirectly’s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya\nIn August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly’s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama’s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we’ve heard in the past:\n) The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that’s fantastic, since we’ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There’s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community.\nBeyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives.\nCavin Oginga (from Kenya) — A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly — who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly’s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having.\nOne of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200–600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her.\n2.) There was really no \"savior barbie\" complex in the GiveDirectly operation — no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what’s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission ‘save the world.’\n3.) Auditing — The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process — from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there’s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited.\n4.) Let’s face it — ‘data’ is boring and unsexy, yet it’s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we’re not talking about just any old data. We’re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — the holy grail of \"I’m right and you’re wrong.\" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I’m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they’re doing something, it’s because their data, and 3 other independent sources’ data has proven that’s the right decision.\n5.) The ‘mission’ per se of how GD gives isn’t about funding what they believe will have the most ‘profitable’ result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it’s the ultimate \"anti\" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4)\nRichard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he’s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren.\nNow, for the meat of it — we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who’ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here’s the breakdown of how their money was spent:\n1.) Housing — everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn’t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5–9 people))\nThis small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family.\na. Thatched roof — which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1–3 years.\ni. Completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?)\nii. Leads to frequent illness / sometimes chronic, and death\niii. Leads to missed frequently school for children\niv. Leads to missed work and income\nb. No home — living with 4–8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut\nc. Upgrading home — living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls)\nd. Dirt floor in home — constant insect infestation, including \"jigas\" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain.\n2.) School Fees — After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2–4 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards.\n3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama’s Grandmother lives!).

Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition—even to their colleagues—is something of a risk in the black and white, \"them and us\" world of police culture.\nEven so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs.\n Neil Woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. Photo courtesy of Neil Woods\nI spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report.\n\"If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,\" he explained. \"You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.\"\nOn the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target.\n\"Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,\" says Fisher. \"The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. We've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves.\n Photo: Andoni Lubaki\nFisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish. \"Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else—usually a lieutenant—replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.\"\nFisher's solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. \"I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,\" he says. \"Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.\"\nSurprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain's elite drug detectives at NCA have similar \"liberal\" attitudes to the drugs problem.\nBut what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall—so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month.\nMost officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. This gave them a \"righteousness\" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with.\nIt's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed \"junkies\" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: \"It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.\"\nTo the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as \"police property\"—objects that police could do with as they wished. \"Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,\" says Bacon. \"They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.\"\n Photo: Marco Tulio Valencia\nDrug cops, who saw themselves as \"elite crime fighters,\" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a \"good collar\" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues.\nDespite all this, there was acceptance—often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints—that they were not waging a \"war on drugs,\" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to \"keep the public happy.\"\nOne detective sergeant told Bacon: \"Sometimes I think we're like those [Japanese] soldiers in World War II—you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over. Only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting.\" Another officer told him: \"We've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.\"\nThere are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. \"I say legalize the lot,\" one said. \"Legalize it and tax it,\" said the other. \"If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. I can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.\"\nI call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods—that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country—but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out.\n\"I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,\" he says. \"I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. But the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault—which all go hand in hand with the drug trade.\n\"We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.\n\"Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. It's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes.\"\nHowever, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : \"With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.\"\nOver the years writing about the drug trade, I've met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker—a series of almost addictive drug bust \"hits\" that perpetuate the game. There are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier END"}

But this is not the reason a seagull loitering at a food factory in Gloucestershire, England, fell into a vat of it this past Monday.\nPerhaps you've seen photos of the bird, colored orange from his dip. (Turmeric, a key ingredient in curry, contains a potent orange pigment.) It looks like he’s trying to cosplay as an Angry Bird.\nBut why?\nSeagulls are what biologists called kleptoparasites , animals that rob the food of other species. And the birds can be damn cunning about it.\nAccording to Seabirds: Feeding Ecology and Role in Marine Ecosystems, kleptoparasitism is a survival strategy that minimizes the energy expenditure needed to obtain food. Basically, the gulls have realized, why search for your own food when there's some perfectly good food in another animal's possession? They need to be clever to do so. Birds that are kleptoparasites tend to have bigger brains than birds that live the straight and narrow.\nFor it to be considered kleptoparasitism, the biologist Erika Iyengar explains , the parasite has to steal food from the host, and the host has to suffer as consequence. (The people who were not able to eat that delicious spiced chicken because, gross, a bird was in it, definitely suffered.)\nAnd it's not just human food. Gulls and some other birds will steal food right from the clutches of other birds, mid-flight.\nSeabirds breaks down the percentage of which species of seabirds get their food from robbing. There are some, like the Arctic skua (a.k.a. the parasitic jaeger), that feast primarily on the food of others.\nGulls are what's known as \"opportunistic kleptoparasites,\" meaning they don't derive 100 percent of their diets from heist but rather just steal when the opportunity arises. And a big vat of tikka masala is an opportunity no gull can afford to miss.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Gulls are what's known as \"opportunistic kleptoparasites,\" meaning they don't derive 100 percent of their diets from heist but rather just steal when the opportunity arises.

In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn’t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King’s novelladoesn’t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How safe is your DNA?\n\nArticle: A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA\nCBS News correspondent Anne Marie Green writes about how she came across this story, and the Angie Dodge murder investigation, which she reported for \"48 Hours\" in \"The DNA of a Killer.\"\nI first learned about the 20-year-old murder of Angie Dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my DNA analyzed by one of those commercial DNA databases. When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation.\nAfter getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road.\nThen I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State’s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest.\nA little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating.\nAs I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie’s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.\nAfter I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge’s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp’s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky.\nChris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the...\nThe day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie’s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp’s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?  \nRight now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. Despite what happened, Michael Usry’s father does not regret participating in a DNA study, but rest assured that his son never will.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie\n\nArticle: I n the Superman comics there is a character called Bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There’s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.\nIn today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.\nAnd yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC’s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.\nIt may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi’s Spiderman films).\nThe present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis’ David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.\nIt’s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson’s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, Hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).\nIf Heath Ledger’s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.\nWhile today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.\nTwo years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi’s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright’s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn’t know the half of it.\nPublished 21 Aug 2016\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable END"}

For as long as I can remember, Disney films have been a major part of my life. Growing up, I constantly watched the classics with my family. Now, I find myself venturing off into some of Disney's newer films. But regardless of the year they are released, almost every Disney film has one thing in common – the main character almost never has a mother. But why?\nThink about it!\nCinderella? No mom. The Little Mermaid? No mom. Pocahontas? No mom. \nNow some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all – like in Aladdin.\nBut even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. Recall Jasmine's dad the Sultan? No wifey.\nWell if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further.\nBecause longtime Disney producer Don Hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind Walt's method.\nAnd one theory behind it is quite sad!\nDon explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up.\nAnd let's face it – most Disney movies are about growing up. \n\"One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up\" says Hahn.\n\"Bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It's a story shorthand.\"\nHahn went on to explain that this isn't a method Disney created himself, but one that he borrowed from many of the fairy tales his movies were based on. \nBut that's not the only possible reason for the lack of motherhood in his movies.\nHahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to Walt and his family. Something tragic that involved his mother...\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " might have been a result of something that happened to Walt and his family. Something tragic that involved his mother END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: What The Heck Was This Smelly Pink Blob Floating In The Indian Ocean?\n\nArticle: The sea is dark and full of terror. Well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of California the other week.\nNow, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of Bunbury, Western Australia, and it’s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn’t be identified – at least at first.\nMark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\"\nThe stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury.\nAfter drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. It looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the Indian Ocean.\nAlthough the exact species of the whale hasn’t been declared, it’s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western Australian coastline.\n\"Seeing it was great,\" Watkins noted on Facebook. \"The smell, not so much.\" Clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry).\nA non-deceased humpback whale.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Will Xbox One be getting Playstation 4.5 style upgrades?\n\nArticle: Getty Image\nConsole wars. Console wars never change. The hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named Nintendo, or so it once seemed. Reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the Playstation 4 the Playstation 4.5, or possibly Playstation 4K thanks to its upgraded GPU which will be used for 4K visuals and the fancy Playstation VR headset. The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.\nNeedless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren’t impressed. Yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when Sony was the altruistic heroes of the Xbox DRM meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming PC.\nSpeaking after Microsoft’s Build 2016 keynote address, Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the Xbox One.\n\"I’m not a big fan of Xbox One and a half. If we’re going to move forward, I want to move forward in big numbers. For us, our box is doing well. It performs, it’s reliable, the servers are doing well. If we’re going to go forward with anything, like I said, I want it to be a really substantial change for people–an upgrade.\"\nOf course, this could be the first step in a PC-ified home-gaming experience. One in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won’t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete. If that’s the case, it will be hard to take the first steps, but Sony could be trailblazing, and that’s never easy to do with the gaming crowd.\n(Via Gamespot)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the Xbox One.

But, as he explains in the YouTube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose.\nWorrall was on a windy construction site when his accident occurred. An incorrectly fastened air duct fell and hit a pair of two-by-fours; Worrall's helmet broke under the impact. He woke up able to move only his eyes. Blinking in a yes-or-no binary code was initially his sole form of communication. His father persuaded him to give it time.\nSome time later, he was introduced to the Jouse, a mouth-operable mouse that made computer use accessible. Worrall began playing \"Diablo,\" and he was hooked.\nKnown online as \"No Hands Ken,\" Worrall streams his play live to a mass audience via Twitch. By placing the Jouse in in his mouth and puffing it, he is able to right-click; by \"sipping,\" he can left-click. According to a Reddit AMA he held after his story's release on YouTube, it took Worrall about a month to master gameplay with the Jouse. And now hundreds of thousands of people have seen him play.\nWorrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. When asked during his Reddit AMA how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, \"Maybe thirty?... When I was in the thousands I was in a loss for words and I had tears running down my face because I've never had that sort of reaction from that many people loving me and wanting the best for me. It made me feel incredible.\"\nAccording to an interview with CTV News, one of his viewers recently wrote him a letter, saying, \"I was about to shoot myself.\" The man who had considered disconnecting is now saving others' lives.\nWorrall has big plans for his future. He's already fundraising so that he can attend BlizzCon, a gaming convention in California, and is considering becoming a motivational speaker.\n\"I am ready to talk to the world about me, my injury and how I live positive every day,\" he wrote on Reddit.\nIt's clear he's off to a strong start.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " online gaming END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Donald Trump takes poll lead over Hillary Clinton – is it time to panic?\n\nArticle: For the first time, Republican Donald Trump seems to have edged ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in presidential polling. But only just. What does it mean and should those opposed to Trump be worried?\nThe polling data site RealClearPolitics (RCP) takes an average of national polls that ask Americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton.\nThat gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude \"it’s probably time to panic\". I’d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it’s been time to panic for a while – zooming out from a single statistic shows it.\nDelayed panic?\nAlthough this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions – in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton’s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. In other words, there have been many other periods when Trump’s opponents should have been worrying before now.\nJust as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that Trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the Republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the White House.\nPart of the reason why they didn’t panic before was a belief that measuring American public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. Why? Because people change their minds. November is still six months away. The alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift.\nLooking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are \"safe\" – based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. Unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might \"swing\" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally – states like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. So far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a Trump win.\nPolling on a pedestal\nAll that said, the RCP polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be.\nThe polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. That’s problematic in itself; this election can’t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate’s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the White House. Each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate’s support is distributed throughout the country.\nDemocratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the Democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. In 2008, Barack Obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. Clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional Democratic strength in populous states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.\nThere’s another, much bigger problem with the RCP average, though: it’s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. RCP always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. Once you peek under the hood, you’ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings. These are the five latest polls RCP used to calculate Trump’s narrow lead:\nABC News/Washington Post: Trump leads by 2 percentage points\nNBC News/Wall Street Journal: Clinton leads by 3 percentage points\nRasmussen Reports: Trump leads by 5 percentage points\nFOX News: Trump leads by 3 percentage points\nCBS News/New York Times: Clinton leads by 6 percentage points\nThese polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion. Although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by NBC/WSJ and Fox News only spoke to registered voters, Rasmussen interviewed \"likely voters\", while the ABC News/Washington Post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters).\nAll polls claim to speak to a \"nationally representative\" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. Perhaps Rasmussen Reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in Iowa – we just don’t know. Languages matter too. Two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in Spanish and English – it seems that the others did not.\nMethodologies matter. They’re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. Take the ABC News/Washington Post poll for example – those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. That means that Trump’s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. Or it could be that Hillary Clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points.\nPolling is far from perfect. To understand what will happen when the country votes this November, pundits would do better to look at the electoral map, demographics and – most importantly of all – listen to the concerns of voters.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it’s been time to panic for a while END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What Daniel Radcliffe thinks of the \"Harry Potter\" spinoff\n\nArticle: There's little doubt that if Daniel Radcliffe were a rock musician, his current press tour for \"Kill Your Darlings\" would have a title like \"The Moving On Tour '13\" or \"Harry In The Rearview Mirror.\" Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is no longer Harry Potter -- as a recent New York Times Magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what's interesting about Radcliffe (great, even) is that he's not anti-Harry Potter.\nHere's your for instance: In \"Kill Your Darlings,\" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from.\nNot only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening.\nI think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like \"The F Word\" and \"Kill Your Darlings.\"\nAnd I think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. When you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like Aaron Johnson or Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw or James McAvoy. And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, \"Oh, I want to do what they're doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well.\" So it builds up this desire to get out there.\n\"The Woman in Black\" felt like its narrative was basically, \"Here's Daniel Radcliffe's first post-Potter role,\" and now, with these, people have moved on.\nI think that's a really astute observation. I think that's completely true. \"The Woman in Black\" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than Harry that people were like, \"Oh, he's just trying to shock us.\" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff I see when I see that that's very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last \"Potter.\" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I've done before. I just think I've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. And I think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and I'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because I feel like I've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves.\nAnd you're playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes.\n[Laughs] Yes. Yeah, I know what you mean. But, you know, I think that's what I liked about Potter and that's what I'm still very proud of about Potter. Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. Because, when I was growing up, I don't remember people talking about franchises before I was in one. I remember people talking about \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Potter\" would be like \"franchises\" that's the first time I remember ...\nLast time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched \"Star Wars.\"\nYes.\nWell, except for \"The Phantom Menace.\"\nLet's not tell anyone that.\nYou have to catch up before \"Episode VII\" comes out.\nI know! I know I do. I have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. Because \"Star Wars\" is filming in Leavesden. There was at least one guy, Digby Milner, who worked on all the \"Potters\" who had also worked on \"Star Wars,\" the originals. And he will be working on new \"Star Wars\" at Leavesdon as well. And it is kind of amazing because \"Star Wars,\" the originals, were made in England as well. So there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new \"Star Wars\" movie.\nIt's come full circle.\nThat's all they do at Leavesdon, apparently, is franchises [laughs].\n\"Kill Your Darlings\" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known.\nI mean, I didn't know the story at all. I really wasn't aware of it. That's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, \"Wow.\" When you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck.\nAllen Ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to.\nAbsolutely. Lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. But I definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. And one of the things I think people will like about this film that I think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear \"1940s Beat poet historical drama,\" you sort of think, Oh, that sounds quite dry. But it's actually a lot of fun as well. I don't think you can make a movie about the Beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time.\nThis might be a bad comparison, but it's got a superhero origin story feel to it, only with writers.\nOh, I've said that a lot.\nLike when we're introduced to Jack Kerouac, it felt dramatic.\nAnd the first time we see Allen's name in the film is on his university application. [Director] John Krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person's name, but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university.\nWhat was your reaction when you heard J.K. Rowling was revisiting the \"Harry Potter\" universe with \"Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them\"? Were you surprised?\nI had never heard her say \"no.\" I don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. But, I think with Jo, I wasn't really surprised. It kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. Because I was kind of like, \"OK, yeah, she's gone off and had 'Casual Vacancy' and then done the Robert Galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. And I imagine that has given her a confidence of, \"Oh, OK, now that I stepped away from it, I can actually go back to it with confidence.\" And I think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the \"Potter\" world. And, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. And I think it will be really good. I'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. That lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic.\nShe doesn't need the money.\nShe definitely doesn't need the money.\nMike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How many of these do you have on your shelf?\n\nArticle: As the populist-conservative movement continues to grow and expand in the Age of President Trump, a new generation of energized voters and young people will do well to arm themselves with the intellectual firepower of the giants upon whose shoulders today’s movement rests.\nHere, then, are seven conservative classics that should be on every American’s bookshelf:\n1. Ideas Have Consequences by Richard Weaver\nOriginally published in 1948, Ideas Have Consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the Left harnessed those forces to undermine Western civilization. One of America’s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, Richard Weaver erected an intellectual fortress around Absolute Truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil.\n2. The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek\nIn the age of Bernie Sanders, today’s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read Friedrich Hayek’s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, The Road to Serfdom. A member of the Austrian School of economics and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism’s conceits. As he put it elsewhere: \"A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.\"\n3. The Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom\nLong before anti-MILO rioters sparked violence at UC Berkeley, a University of Chicago professor named Allan Bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. A staunch defender of the classical \"canon\" of great works every thinking person must read, Bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students’ understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds Western Civilization.\n4. A Choice Not an Echo by Phyllis Schlafly\nThe late great matriarch of modern conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. The tip of her intellectual spear, A Choice Not an Echo, reshaped the contours of American conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. The original anti-establishment crusader, Schlafly’s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the Republican Party’s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for Barry Goldwater’s nomination.\n5. Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman\nNobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman redefined the field of economics. In addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. Any Nobel Prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: \"If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there’d be a shortage of sand.\"\n6. A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell\nThere are no \"bad\" Thomas Sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. But A Conflict of Visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies—and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. One of America’s most lucid conservative economists, Sowell’s book draws upon everything from Rousseau to Hobbes to Adam Smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do.\n7. Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\nHailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, Gulag Archipelago is the first-person account of Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the Russian gulags for criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Communist system in his private letters. A winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, Solzhenitsyn’s ability to combine lyrical prose with piercing reportage of communism’s moral horrors are virtually without equal.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is why no one wants to work with Katherine Heigl anymore\n\nArticle: Katherine Heigl's behavior on set has become notoriously difficult, and a scathing article by Kim Masters for The Hollywood Reporter rounded up a number of industry insiders who are getting fed up with the star once known fondly as Dr. Izzie Stevens.\nHeigl's behavior has sparked some sour reactions in the past. Most notably, the actress publicly knocked her two biggest successes, calling \"Knocked Up\" sexist and announcing she would not seek an Emmy for her role in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" because the writing wasn't up to her standards.\nAccording to Hollywood insiders, the issue extends to her conduct on set. One source from the 2010 film \"Life As We Know It\" recalled \"desperately difficult situations\" with the actress, saying, \"she can cost you time every single day of shooting ... wardrobe issues, not getting out of the trailer, questioning the script every single day.\"\nExcept it wasn't just Heigl causing problems on set ... her mother was often part of the problem. The \"Life As We Know It\" source added: \"I have never experienced anything like Nancy Heigl. It's about the mouth. 'F--- you. You are a f---ing liar.' ... Whatever you'd say, you were an idiot. The call would be, 'This is the worst craft service we've ever had! There's nothing to eat! This is the worst wardrobe!'

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Best Foods to Help You Sleep\n\nArticle: Whether it’s a jolt after a cup of coffee or drowsiness after Thanksgiving dinner, most people have personally experienced how food and drinks can affect their energy and alertness.\nWith as many as 35% of American adults suffering from symptoms of insomnia, it’s understandable that there’s a strong desire to take advantage of food and drinks for better sleep.\nBoth diet and sleep are complex, which means there’s no silver bullet or single food that is guaranteed to help with sleep. However, there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night’s sleep.\nSpecific Foods That Can Affect Sleep\nResearchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. While this research provides important clues, it’s not conclusive. In general, there’s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep.\nIn addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent. For example, some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. Climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product.\nThat said, there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep. Sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink.\nDietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness; they can play a major role in things like weight, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar levels just to name a few. For that reason, it’s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet. Doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well.\nKiwi\nThe kiwi or kiwifruit is a small, oval-shaped fruit popularly associated with New Zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries. There are both green and gold varieties, but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers.\nKiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals, most notably vitamins C and E as well as potassium and folate.\nSome research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep. In a study, people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster, slept more, and had better sleep quality.\nIt is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep, but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties, ability to address folate deficiencies, and/or high concentration of serotonin.\nTart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice\nAs the name indicates, tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries. Sometimes called sour cherries, these include cultivars like Richmond, Montmorency, and English morello. They may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice.\nSeveral studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice. In one study, people who drank two one-cup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency.\nThese benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have above-average concentrations of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep. Tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep.\nMalted Milk and Nighttime Milk\nMalted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour, malted wheat, and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins. It is popularly known as Horlick’s, the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder.\nIn the past, small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions. The explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the B and D vitamins in malted milk.\nMilk itself contains melatonin, and some milk products are melatonin-enriched. When cows are milked at night, their milk has more melatonin, and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleep-producing hormone.\nFatty Fish\nA research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep. The study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning.\nResearchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in the body’s regulation of serotonin. This study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin D levels tend to be lower.\nNuts\nNuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep. Though the exact amounts can vary, nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes. In a clinical trial using supplements, it was found that a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep.\nRice\nStudies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall, but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep.\nA study of adults in Japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles. This study only identified an association and cannot demonstrate causality, but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep.\nAt the same time, sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep, so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal. Additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleep-related effects of different carbohydrates.\nThe impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them. For example, a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan, a sleep-promoting amino acid, and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain. Turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Kiwi\nTart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice\nMalted Milk and Nighttime Milk\nFatty Fish\nNuts END"}

'It's better to use a lighter, fresher foundation to make the skin look more natural,' he advises. 'Just use concealer where you need it.'\nStay away from pressed powders: Rupert King maintains that they create a heavier, dryer look to the skin. 'Instead, aim for a more dewy, moist look to the skin, it will help to soften those dryers areas where the fine lines can show up. If you still feel too shiny choose a micro fine loose powder and just apply to the centre of the face.'   \nAvoid nude lipsticks: Rupert believes this hue can make you look sallow and drained and women should choose colours with a fresher coral or peach undertone. \nDon't skip the moisturiser: Karla Powell, MUA and brand ambassador for MUA Cosmetics, says that applying make-up to un-moisturised dry skin can enhance your lines. So before applying your make-up pack on a rich moisturiser, which will leave your skin feeling nourished and smoother. \nAlways do your brows: Brows tend to thin as we age, but having a structured brow can take years off of your face, instantly lifting and defining your eye area. Karla advises avoiding gels and pencils - which can leave brows looking too harsh and ‘drawn on’ - and opt for a powder formula, which will give a much more natural finish. 'Never go too dark as this can age you, aim to choose only a shade or two darker than your hair colour,' she adds.\nStop using a heavy coverage foundation\nStay away from pressed powders \nAvoid nude lipsticks\nDon't skip the moisturiser\nAlways do your brows with powder\nDon't apply blush to the apples of your cheeks\nAvoid dark eyes \nBeware of the blush: Denise Rabor, international makeup artist and founder of Wow Beauty, says many people believe you should apply blusher to the apples of your cheeks, which is incorrect as this can draw your face downwards.\n'You should actually brush blusher sparingly from your ear to halfway across your cheekbone, which will make your face look slimmer,' he said. \nAvoid dark eyes: Celebrity facialist and makeup artist, Nathalie Eleni, says that dark kohl under the eye can look harsh if not blended so opt for a softer shadow and blend along for a softer finish.\nApply under-eye cream correctly: Eva Alexandrides, managing director and co-founder of 111Skin, explains that the skin underneath the eye is a different structure to the rest of the face and thus is a lot more sensitive. 'Rubbing and pulling at the skin as you apply the cream is a real no go and will make the bags appear worse and more visible.\n'Use your ring or little finger when applying cream whilst only dabbing, tapping or softly massaging the area with sweeping strokes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What State Has the Worst Drivers\n\nArticle: When ordinary conversation turns to driving, many are quick to declare drivers from their state the worst. But which state can actually make that claim? A recent study conducted by Insure.com surveyed 2,000 drivers from across the country to determine once and for all which state has the rudest drivers of them all. And the results will surprise you.\nIt's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the Rocky Mountains: Idaho.\n(MORE: 10 Cities With the Worst Drivers)\nThe survey concluded that Idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- \"those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off.\" The imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the Gem State to the top of the list.\nOne responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the Northwest. Eric Leins of Southern California posited that Idaho's rural and mountainous terrain was to blame. He argued that residents and seasoned drivers are familiar with the twists and turns and lack the patience for those who are navigating the state's roads for the first time. Another survey responder said that he thinks everyone in that state is just content to take their time on the roads and don't seem to have the same sense of urgency drivers in other states have.\n(MORE: The Most Beautiful States in the World)\nThe study's runner-up rudest state is the nation's capitol: Washington, D.C. A respondent who had relocated to the District of Columbia from Los Angeles compared the attitude of driving to the town's politics: \"self-serving, abrasive and unsafe.\" Another indicated that he wished he had a nickel for every driver who couldn't be bothered to signal when switching lanes.\nRounding out the top five are New York, Wyoming, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Idaho END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Are You Reading The Wrong Books? What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers\n\nArticle: Will S.\nFor most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They’ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read!\nWhat has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on. It’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading.\nIn 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty,\n\"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\"\nYour brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people.\nThis compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\"\nThe conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry.\nWhat does this all mean?\nSure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits?\nThe authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com:\n\"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\"\nThrough their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study).\nIn 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby.\nReading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise.\nLike opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own! So after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. Take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. And in choosing your next book, make it a tough one.\nYour brain will thank you.\nWhich book inspires you the most?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " more empathetic towards others END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Does your iq correlate with the rap music you listen to?\n\nArticle: So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I’ve seen tweets before that have told me that I’m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.\nFirst of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I’ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross’ God Forgives, I Don’t. What haven’t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).\nSo if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD’s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence.\nNow, I can’t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I’m not considering the force that is Death Grips’ Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I’m not) is Lil Yachty’s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I’ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What’s wrong with putting Kodak Black’s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar’s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist?\nIn fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what I thought. It’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.\nThere will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I’m guilty of it as much as I’m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It’s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There’s a reason Common isn’t ever requested at the bar. I don’t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song?\nHip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn’t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn’t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes. A person’s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person’s brain power. So stop hating, throw on some Lil Yachty, and don’t be afraid to like it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart.

With her flat stomach, toned arms and excellent health, you'd never guess that this female bodybuilder is in her late 70s. But she is -- 77, to be exact.\nAs impressive as her physique is, one of the most incredible parts of Shepherd's story is that she didn't even start working out until she was 56.\nShepherd and her sister, Mildred Blackwell, decided to get fit after they tried on swimsuits and weren't happy with what they saw in the mirror. The sisters set their sights on becoming two of the oldest female bodybuilders. However, after Mildred died, the devastated Shepherd ended up with high blood pressure, panic attacks, acid reflux and depression. Then, Shepherd says her sister appeared to her in a dream, urging her to follow through with the bodybuilding dream they had conceived together.\nShepherd did, and was declared the World's Oldest Performing Female Bodybuilder by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010. (Edith Wilma Conner now holds the title.)\nSince then, Shepherd says her health had dramatically improved. \"I do the same thing day in and day out,\" she says on an episode of \"Oprah Prime\" that also featured Sharon Stone. \"No high blood pressure medicine.

The more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling , the stronger those circuits get.\nThe ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections.\nFor years this has been the focus for learning new things. But as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. Even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. It’s called \"synaptic pruning.\" Here’s how it works.\nYour Brain’s Delete Button And How to Use It\nImagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across.\n\"Glial cells\" are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. But other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. Your brain’s pruning gardeners are called \"microglial cells.\" They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune?\nResearchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse.\nThis is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more.\nHave you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.\nWhen you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What would happen if the Olympics banned Russia?\n\nArticle: Imagine the most stereotypically Russian way an Olympic doping scandal could play out. Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you’d be absolutely right.\nThis morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia’s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations’ ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there’s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it’s also still possible it will ban the country altogether—a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics.\nMarcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted—meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games.\nIf the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, \"no dirtier than average\"), his models suggest they’re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals.\nIf the IOC does ban Russia, that’s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US’s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. \"For the Olympic movement, it’s a huge deal,\" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"This isn’t Tonga or Paraguay, it’s one of three big medal winners.\"\nFor the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. \"You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,\" says Wallechinsky. \"That’s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot.\" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it’s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000.\nThe potential Russian ban wouldn’t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes’ doping is inherently political. \"If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,\" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so.\nOne of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. \"The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,\" says Gleaves. \"How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?\" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports.\nWhich may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts,\" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics . He puts on his best John Goodman: \"‘I’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\" Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts,\" says David Goldblatt , author ofThe Games: A Global History of the Olympics. He puts on his best John Goodman: \"‘I’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\"\nAnd this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. \"At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women’s competitions,\" says Noland. \"There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil.\" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How the legal drinking age of 21 actually saves lives\n\nArticle: Laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking, according to a new review of studies.\nResearchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people.\nResearchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested.\n\"Recent research ...has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths,\" the researchers wrote in their study published today (Feb. 24) in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.\n\"The evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age,\" said study researcher William DeJong of Boston University School of Public Health. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]\nU.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated.\nAdvocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. They also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption.\nHowever, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents.\nIn fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\nTeen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the Federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21.\nDuring that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25.\nLooking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea.\nOn the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. In one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states.\nResearchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. Instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said.\n\"Clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law — and advertise that fact to students — student drinking declines,\" DeJong said.\n\"Some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them,\" DeJong said. \"But it really is the case that enforcement works.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking END"}

Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg\n\"There’s a large Middle Eastern population in Detroit, and I’ve been really influenced by the brightness of Middle Eastern flavors,\" Ludwinski said over the phone. \"Also I have a total obsessive love for tahini.\"\nOne of Michigan native Ludwinski’s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a Cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. \"I will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing,\" Ludwinski says. It’s no coincidence that at Sister Pie she designed an open kitchen, too. Anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand.\nSister Pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg\nLudwinski moved to New York in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. At Momofuku's Milk Bar, where she worked for Christina Tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat Plugra butter, which Ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. \"You’ve got to use it every time,\" she says, \"because the flavor is so different, and so clear.\" She picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ludwinski spent a year making pies. Ludwinski says this gives the crust a bit of extra flake and a mild tang.\nThis Thanksgiving will mark the shop’s first holiday since its opening back in April in Detroit's West Village, and Ludwinski is planning to stay open until noon to sell locals fresh pies like sweet potato-marshmallow, brandy-pecan, and salted maple pumpkin. \"It just seems kind of silly for a pie shop to be closed on Thanksgiving,\" she says.\nLisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg\nLudwinski’s mother has already ordered pies for the family’s holiday meal from Sister Pie, and her grandmother will supplement the dessert spread with her own pumpkin pie. That one will be made according to the directions on the side of the can, using ready-made pie dough, and it will also be gone before the end of the day.\nSister Pie is at 8066 Kercheval Ave., Detroit, MI 48214; +1 (313) 447-5550 or sisterpie.com.\nNote that if you're not up for doing everything from scratch, you can follow a side-of-the-can pie recipe and just add that bottom layer of Ludwinski's lovely sesame-walnut paste for a delicious twist.\nCardamom-Tahini Squash Pie\nAdapted from Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie, Detroit\nIngredients:\nFor the pie dough\n2 1⁄2 cups all­-purpose flour\n1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into chunks\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1⁄2 cup ice water, with a splash of apple cider vinegar\nFor the tahini-walnut paste\n5 tablespoons toasted, ground walnuts\n2 1⁄2 tablespoons tahini\n2 1⁄2 tablespoons light brown sugar\n2 1⁄2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened\nPinch of salt\nFor the squash purée\n2 winter squash (such as butternut, buttercup, or hubbard)\n1⁄2 cup canned pumpkin purée\n2 tablespoons butter\nFor the cardamom cream\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 tablespoon cardamom pods\nFor the pie filling\n1⁄2 cup light brown sugar\n1 tablespoon cornmeal\n1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon powder\n1⁄2 teaspoon cardamom powder\n1⁄2 teaspoon grated ginger\n1⁄2 teaspoon allspice powder\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n3 eggs\n1 cup cardamom cream (see below)\n2 1⁄4 cups squash purée (see below)\nTo assemble and finish\n1 egg, beaten\n1 tablespoon black and white sesame seeds, toasted\nStep by step: blind-baking crusts, filling them with tahini-walnut paste, pouring over the roasted squash filling, and getting the pies into the oven. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg\nMethod:\n1. Prepare the pie dough: I​n a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it’s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes).\n2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin purée and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside.\n3. Make the cardamom cream: I​n a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. Turn off heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside to cool.\n4. Mix the filling: I​n a medium bowl, w​hisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. In another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined.\n5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that’s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 ­inches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.\n6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P​reheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.\nTravel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.\n7.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Apple Files New Patent And You Won’t Believe What It Is For\n\nArticle: Apple will open its first retail store in South Korea. The country is Samsung's home turf.\n(Scurzuzu / Flickr)\nApple is massively known as one of the top purveyors of new innovations and advancements in technology. With the new patent filed by Apple recently, no one would not think what the Cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline.\nApple has filed lately a patent application with code US 20160264304 A1 for a paper bag. According to a report by The Telegraph, the patent is described as \"a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.\"\nThe report stressed that this quirky innovation by Apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. Apart from the patent being filed by Apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation.\nAccordingly, this paper bag is made of 60% recycled materials. As Apple's application stated, \"The bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.\"\nIt furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing. However, like the wireless earbuds Apple produced for the iPhone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens.\nMeanwhile, the company has slowly been introducing efforts to improve current state of the environment. Earlier this year, Apple made public a robot called Liam to partake in recycling old iPhone units. In 2015, the company said almost 100% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " paper bag. END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: \"How To Talk To A Woman Who Is Wearing Headphones\"\n\nArticle: A recent and deeply-sinister guide for men on how to talk to women wearing headphones has outraged many. Here’s a more honest and accurate guide\nAn article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot ‘n’ horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn’t a parody.\nYou can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It’s going to be quite a ride.\nHow to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones\n\"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time.\nYet, that doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them.\nOf course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking.\nHowever, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\"\nThe author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \"How to\" with \"Don’t\". Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here\nyou see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn’t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It’s a defence. A defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don’t want to be talked to. It’s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in.\nBut back to Dan:\nWhat to Do to Get Her Attention\n1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you).\n2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile.\n3. Is she hasn’t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can’t ignore it.\n4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \"Take off your headphones for a minute\" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands.\nIf she doesn’t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \"I want to talk to you for a minute.\"\nIn most cases, you won’t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening.\n5. Then, do what we call \"Acknowledging the Awkwardness\" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn’t the most common of experiences for either party.\nThis helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to.\nI don’t know if these five steps are a common \"thing\", but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I’m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I’m not feeling \"excited\" and I’m not feeling \"flattered\" as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I’m feeling harassed. Straight up, dictionary definition harassed.\nBy step 4 I’ve learnt that you can’t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it’s trying to figure out just how aggressively you’re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time.\nAccording to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \"cool guy\". Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a ‘t’, Dan.\nHere’s Dan’s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security:\nYou: [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey – I know it’s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought – wow, she’s a cutie, I have to say hi. I’m Dan, what’s your name?\nWoman: [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica.\nYou: [Add in some humor] Cool...nice to meet you Jessica. I don’t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me.\nWoman: [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction].\nYou: [Let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you’re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I’m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I’m on my way to a store up the street. How’s your day going so far?\nIn his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling.\nHere’s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I’ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors:\nHim: I see you don’t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I’m making that your problem.\nHer: Please leave me alone.\nHim: F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN’T FANCY YOU ANYWAY.\nWith \"advice\" like this out there, it’s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn’t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook.\nNext Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off.\nPoints 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3.\n2. Allowing her to ignore him\n\"Headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world.\nThat being said, if a guy wants to get a woman’s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him.\nIf a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won’t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones.\nWomen love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy’s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner?\nThis is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her.\nIf a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\"\n3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction\n\"No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn’t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to.\nControlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\"\nThe advice here is basically \"No doesn’t mean no,\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 5 Video Games That Are Taking Forever to Come Out\n\nArticle: Making video games is many things, but easy isn’t one of them. Depending on the scope of the project, a single game can take hundreds of people several years to build. And with fickle markets and studios losing funding, even after a game is announced, there’s still a chance it will be canceled like these promising games.\nBut some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others, and sometimes those games seem like they’ll never come out. Here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied, games that people are chomping at the bit to play — games we’ve been waiting on for a very long time.\n5. Beyond Good & Evil 2\nThe original Beyond Good & Evil came out in 2003. It’s a unique game that stars Jade, an investigative reporter who’s working on a case about a planet-wide alien conspiracy. She can kick serious butt when the situation dictates, but she’s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she has a free moment.\nThe game was originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy, but poor sales put a wrench in those gears. Still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. In the years since, an HD remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven’t heard much about the purported sequel. Is it still in the works? Will it really see the light of day? We may have a while more to wait before we know for sure.\nWhen we might see it: Ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation. According to one rumor, it could be an NX exclusive.\n4. Kingdom Hearts 3\nFor a certain segment of fans, the Kingdom Hearts games are a dream come true. They combine beloved Disney characters with fan favorites from Square Enix’s Final Fantasy series. If you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you’re well aware of this long-running series.\nThe original Kingdom Hearts came out for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. So it’s kind of strange that the series hasn’t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and — some would say — filler. Never fear. A third installment is on its way, and it’s coming only to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. No release date has been set, but have faith that this one will actually happen.\nWhen we might see it: Hopefully by 2017.\n3. Final Fantasy XV\nFun fact: The game that’s currently called Final Fantasy XV began under the title Final Fantasy XIII Versus, which was first shown to the public way back in 2006. Here we are closing in on a decade later, and this game still hasn’t made it to market. What’s going on?\nWell, Final Fantasy, once the leading series of Japanese role-playing games, has fallen on somewhat hard times. The 13th installment in particular didn’t exactly light the world on fire. In fact, most fans of the series would agree that it’s been a slow downhill slide since Final Fantasy X came out in 2001.\nDeveloper Square Enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a Big Important Game for the series’ 15th installment. And judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside Final Fantasy Type-O HD, they’re on the right track. Will the finished product live up to expectations? For that, we’ll have to wait and see.\nWhen we might see it: November 29, 2016\n2. The Last Guardian\nMany longtime PlayStation gamers have a strong connection to the works of Team Ico. So far, the developer has only released two titles, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, but they’re both singular, beautiful games that have made a lasting impression. The Last Guardian is Team Ico’s next project, first announced with this trailer in 2009. The game was scheduled to come out in 2011, but it never made it to market.\nFans finally got a fresh look at the game at E3 2015, and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it. Despite assurances that it’ll launch in 2016, many fans are still skeptical.\nWhen we might see it: Sometime in 2016... hopefully.\n1. Half-Life 3\nIf there’s one game more famous for not existing than The Last Guardian, it’s Half-Life 3. If you haven’t played the other Half-Life games, you might be wondering what the big deal is. First off, it’s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. In fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. It’s no stretch to say that the original Half-Life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all.\nMaking matters worse, however, is that the last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. But instead of continuing that series and playing off that story’s big ol’ hanging thread, Valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) Portal series. By now the demand for Half-Life 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if Valve does eventually deliver the game, it couldn’t possibly live up to expectations. But do us a solid anyway, Valve — give us Half-Life 3!\nWhen we might see it: No idea, and there’s no evidence that it’s in development.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. Half-Life 3\n2.

When the former First Lady, and wife of George W.

She added that the candidate should \"pay attention to our history, and know what's happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.\"\nThough she was careful not to name names, some news outlets, including the Telegraph , have speculated that she was referring to Hillary Clinton who worked to improve lives of women in developing countries during her time as Secretary and State.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is buying organic really worth it?\n\nArticle: Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it?\nLast week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.\nOrganic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.\nProducing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.\nThough there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?\nThe answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.\nWhat the heck does organic mean anyway?\nOrganic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.\n\"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.\nWhen it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.\nThere’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an \"excuse to charge more.\"\nIndeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.\nStill, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.\nA 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and \"substantially higher\" levels of antioxidants.\nSo, what does this mean for human health?\nAccording to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.\nPesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.\nThe jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.\nIn the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,\" said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. \"It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don’t know enough about the health effects.\"\nSome organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.\nWhen it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.\nThe 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.\nA recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.\n\"Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,\" wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.’s Newcastle University. \"But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.\"\nAs for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.\nThe Centers for Disease Control notes that \"[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health\" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.\nOther ways of measuring \"worth\":\nWhen considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.\n\"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\"\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.\nBut organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.\nThough the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.\nLu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.\n\"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\"\nAccording to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.\n\"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes.\nMany organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.\nOrganic on a budget\nRegularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just \"buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.\"\nAnd there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):\n1. Prioritize your purchases.\n\"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.\nShe also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.\n\"Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said.\nChoosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu.\nFor produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.\n\"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg.\nThe Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.\n2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or C\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Depending on your priorities, it might be END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: This state is the most magical place in America\n\nArticle: There's a reason \"Rocky Mountain High\" is one of Colorado's official state songs. Because regardless of your feelings on legalized pot, Colorado will leave you feeling absolutely magical.\nIf you're an urbanite, a mountaineer, a ski bum, a history nerd, an outdoor adventurer... you get the point... there is something for you in Colorado. And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul.\nNot convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America.\n1. Because with \"300 days of sunshine,\" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America.\nAnd who doesn't love a sunny day? The \"300 days of sunshine\" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome.\n2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun.\nColorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The highest is Mt. Elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level. Denver, the state's capital, legitimately earns its nickname of \"Mile High City\" standing at an elevation of 5,280 feet high. At these elevations, the sun is stronger. You also could potentially get drunk faster.\n3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place.\nColorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries.\n4. Because, the Rockies.\nWhether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most visited national parks, for good reason. Breathtaking views are guaranteed, whether the mountains are blanketed in snow or lush green trees.\n5. You can rock out surrounded by rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheater.\nIt's been called one of the best amphitheaters in America. If you can't get concert tickets, visiting by day and hiking a trail or having a picnic is a great way to experience Red Rocks.\n6. Or spend some heavenly time at Garden of the Gods.\nAs far as U.S. natural wonders go, this is a must see. The National Natural Landmark offers beautiful rock formations and other archeological wonders.\n7. Or visit the Flatirons, which are some of the coolest looking foothills you'll ever see.\nThe Flatirons are located in Boulder and have a rich climbing history. They're cool to view from afar and the climbs themselves offer terrific views and some challenging routes.\n8. Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster.\nWell, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road. But still, driving up and then down a mountain is an experience every thrill-seeker should experience, and the Rockies are perfect for it. Try Loveland Pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop.\n9. Travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns.\nThese cool little old-school mining towns look like they're out of a movie (or Snow White, maybe?). Most people associate the gold rush with California, but let's not forget Pike's Peak and Colorado's role in the fun. Follow the Colorado Gold Trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like Idaho Springs, Breckenridge and Black Hawk. Mine tours are also available in many towns as well.\n10. Denver's homegrown burger chain, Smashburger, is beyond delicious.\nWhile it's up for debate where the original smashburger came from, Smashburger as we know it today is Denver born and bred. Denver is also home to the first ever Chipotle... which is pretty cool, though you can eat Chipotle pretty much anywhere these days.\n11. Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you could always try Rocky Mountain Oysters.\nWarning: Rocky Mountain Oysters are not actually oysters. They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not.\n11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball.\nThe home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country. And the ballpark's not just for fans -- the over-the-top stadium offers plenty to eat and drink, and sweeping views of Denver and the mountains beyond. Tickets start as low as $4, so it's a great deal.\n12. Colorado's welcome signs are cooler than yours.\n13. Denver is mecca for all things delicious, fun and cheap.\nBeer is cheap, ice cream is in abundance and the cost of living won't leave you totally broke. Denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire.\n14. And Boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course.\n15. Because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally.\nBoth in-state residents and visitors (over 21-years-old) can shop at the dispensaries, though Coloradans can purchase more product than tourists. And these shops don't just sell weed... they sell marijuana-infused edibles, oils, beverages and more. If you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven. Keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the state.\n16. Colorado is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command... And you know what they do, right?\nThey track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, duh.\n17. Want some thrills? How about white water rafting? Zip lining? Ice climbing? Hang gliding?\nThe state is an adrenaline junkie's paradise.\n18. Because Colorado sets records... Zombie Crawl records, that is.\n19. And, if you haven't figured it out yet, Colorado is paradise for the outdoorsy type.\nYou can't beat these numbers -- Colorado boasts four national parks, 42 state parks, 11 national forests, two national grasslands and eight national wildlife refuges. There's always another trail to hike or mountain to climb... could you ever be bored?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Colorado END"}

I guess a lot of this is James Cameron. But he’s brilliant.

Everyone will still have access to the Upside Down. Great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. There will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. They assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. \"We obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of Hawkins.

This way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. \"We’re letting the story dictate it,\" says Matt. \"I think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. We want to make sure it’s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it’s never treading water. We want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1.

Sitting on a leather couch in Park City, Utah with a Bloody Mary by his side, Slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed, \"God’s Pocket,\" which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival.\nThe dark comedy needs a better adjective than \"dark,\" because most of the film reveals deeply-rooted sadness, disappointment and failures –- carried out to perfection by a dream-team cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christina Hendricks, Richard Jenkins and John Turturro. Slattery has directed five episodes of \"Mad Men\" but this is his first attempt at a feature. Based on the theater’s applause on opening night, his future as a director certainly looks bright.\nThe Huffington Post joined Slattery couch-side to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen, how surfing keeps him from getting \"a little screwy\" and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time.\n[Warning: plot spoilers throughout]\nWhen did you originally come across the material for \"God’s Pocket\"?\nI read the book by Pete Dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it. But it’s a good thing I didn’t get the rights, because I probably wouldn't be able to actually make a good movie then. I tried getting the rights but someone else owned them. So I let it go.\nAbout five years later, someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book? Turns out the rights were then available. So I said, all right I’m going to outline this thing, because I had written a shitty screenplay in between and I didn’t want to do that again. I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let’s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available. Same people still owned it.\nAfter you had put all that time into it!\nI was making \"The Adjustment Bureau\" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. So it was like are you going to watch TV or do this? When I was told I couldn’t have it, I thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven’t done anything with it I’m just going to write it anyway. And if someone else makes it first, fine. Eventually Bob Gersh from The Gersh Agency worked out the deal.\nDo you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn’t have it at first?\nIt sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. When you’re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, I would do this. At the end of the day, I’d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and I wouldn’t feel crazy that day.\nDo you have a different itch that’s satisfied by writing versus acting?\nIt’s the same if I were acting in a play or directing. Creative people go on vacation and four days in you’re like I gotta get out of here. I have a lot of energy, so I’m told. I surf a lot.\nYou live in L.A.?\nHalf the time. For \"Mad Men\" we’re in New York so I have a place I go surfing in Long Island.\nIsn’t that freezing?\nIn the winter it is. But there’s all kinds of gear now, it’s like skiing almost. If I sit around and do nothing for a while, I get a little screwy.\nWhat did you find most compelling about the material in \"God’s Pocket\"? What made you want to make this film?\nIt’s very visual, which appealed to me. I sort of see things in pictures -- I don’t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. Like a kid almost. And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything.\nThe book is very interior. It takes place in Mickey’s head, which was difficult to do in a film. You have to show that, you can’t tell it. That was a challenge. Mickey’s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. He feels that if I lose this woman then I’ll never get anybody else like that. I think there’s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. So even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn’t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman.\nWhat I think you get from Christina’s performance is the disappointment she feels. He’s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that’s not going very well. He can’t express himself. And she needs something. She needs to find out what happened to her son. She needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he’s trying but they’re missing each other.\nDid you consider acting in the film?\nNo. I got asked if I was going to, and every time I said no, people were like, \"good idea.\" [laughs] Which I was like, \"what the hell do you mean by that?\"\nI ask because you’ve directed a handful of \"Mad Men\" episodes.\nThat’s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -– being in it. Some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. Because you know what you’re doing on one side of the camera and know what you’re doing on the other.\nLike Woody Allen, I mean I would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is Woody Allen. He knows what he knows and he has the time he has. Ben Affleck -- I have to say, I admire the hell out of that guy with a move like \"Argo.\" To direct it and then give that kind of performance. I don’t know how the hell he dealt with that stress.\nAnother example of directors starring in movies is here at Sundance –- Zach Braff’s new film \"Wish I Was Here.\"\nI’m interested in Zach taking 10 years to do this. I’m sure there are all kinds of reasons –- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. I’d like to try it sometime, but you’d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn’t feel like \"Oh I shouldn’t have done this.\"\nHow did you cast this film? Did you just ask Christina Hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie?\nI went to Phil [Seymour Hoffman] first. You go through the proper channels because you don’t want to burden anybody with \"do me a favor.\" That’s a drag. I sent him the script and I anticipated that he would let me down easy and say I like it but I don’t have time. I had sent it with an offer for the part of Shelburne. He called and said, \"I love the script, but I want to play Mickey.\" And it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. So I said all right, in.\nThen I mentioned it to Christina because I was directing an episode of \"Mad Men\" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. I hadn’t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here’s the script, I’d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored.\nThere’s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film.\nShe condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. All these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it’s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. She knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. She realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. But then he doesn’t give her what she wants. And in the end she watches him\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Slattery\n'God's Pocket' END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This U.S. city will soon have the nation's most-taxed cigarettes\n\nArticle: Taxes on cigarettes are rising yet again in Chicago with a 50-cent increase that makes smokes in the Windy City the most highly-taxed in the country.\nChicago's City Council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel's 2014 budget on Tuesday.\nIn combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $7.17 a pack, WGN reports. Chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than New York City’s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation.\nAccording to Emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the Tribune reports.\nThough the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from Mayor Emanuel. The mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards.\nThe $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports.\nAld. Jason Ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayor's decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside the city.\n\"We still create the black market when we raise that bar at any level,\" Ervin told the Sun-Times.\nHealth officials, meanwhile, were dismayed that the tax on cigarettes wasn't higher.\n\"The cheaper the cigarettes, the more people who are going to buy cigarettes and the more people who are going to die,\" the American Heart Association’s Mark Peysakhovich told the Sun-Times the day before the City Council vote.\nThe city, however, is still cracking down on smoking in other ways: Emanuel and a few key aldermen are reportedly looking to heavily restrict e-cigarette use in the city with rules that would effectively ban them from public spaces.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Chicago END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The \"sexy lie\" we should all be talking about\n\nArticle: \"I am here today to talk about a lie.\"\nThat's how politics professor Caroline Heldman opened her Jan. 2013 TEDxYouth San Diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification.\n\"I'd like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering.\"\nHeldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: \"It's like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red.\" She added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because American culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable.\nHowever, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to Heldman:\nInstead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. A spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. So if there's anything I can pitch to you about why you don't want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure.\nHeldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying. An image is sexually objectifying if \"yes\" is the answer to any of the following questions:\nDoes the image show only parts of a sexualized person's body? Does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? Does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? Does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that can't consent? Does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? Does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity? Does the image treat a sexualized person's body as a canvas?\nPerhaps the most powerful part of the video is the end, where Heldman invites us to \"imagine a different world,\" offering viewers tools to navigate, and eventually, change objectification culture.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why We Sent a Reporter to Work as a Private Prison Guard\n\nArticle: Read Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer's firsthand account of his four months spent working as a guard at a corporate-run prison in Louisiana.\nIn 1887, a 23-year-old journalist got herself checked into the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island in New York City. When she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, \"lunatics\" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants.\nSerialized by Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, Nellie Bly's accounts (later collected in a book called Ten Days in a Mad-House) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck—she'd begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled \"What Girls Are Good For\"—though her ingénue looks couldn't have hurt, either. But despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, Bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed.\nAccess to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.\nBly—who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days—was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones.\nBut while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase:\nWhen the information obtained is of vital public interest.\nWhen other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted.\nWhen the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception.\nWhen the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story.\nWhen the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused.\nAfter meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues.\nTo see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking.\nWe took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons—often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates—dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.\nBut here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties—i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements—once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyoncé videos—are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other \"non-disparagement\" clauses and \"employer protection statutes.\" Somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny—even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government.\nCompanies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny.\nOr when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had \"knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,\" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities. When he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us.\nShane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed. But don't let anyone distract you from the story itself. Because the story itself is revealing as hell.\nIf you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to Mother Jones to help underwrite our investigations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed.

And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk’s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed.\nThe report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don’t receive enough iron in their diet.\nThat doesn’t even begin to address all the economic factors at play.\n\"Half of the babies born in this country are participating in Women, Infants and Children program here in the United States,\" Lucy Sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 Days, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as WIC.\n\"That’s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the U.S. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country,\" she added. \"It is all of us. The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America.\"\nHugh Welsh, the president of DSM, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the U.S. about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients.\n\"I could travel to Malawi, and everyone there would understand, but I could travel to Milwaukee and no one would understand what I was talking about with micronutrients,\" he said.\nIn the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form. Without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child’s brain may never form all its potential synapses. They can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs.\nExperts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese American adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems.\nThe face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America. Lucy Sullivan, Executive Director of 1,000 Days\nBarbara Bush, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps, stressed the irreversibility of the first 1,000 days.\n\"You can’t catch up,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"It will impact everything you do, whether that be how you learn or if you can learn fully and all of your mechanisms to engage in life.\"\nRep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) echoed Bush: \"These children are losing the chance to reach their full potential before they even get started.\"\nAdvocates said they were pleased the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services have started to develop the first-ever dietary guidelines for children under the age of 2, but those standards are not expected until 2020. The panel and congressional leaders highlighted the need for legislation about increased nutritional information and paid family leave.\nSen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said the issue requires bipartisan action.\n\"This has to be a commitment to putting kids, and their need for access to food and nutrition, in the front of the agenda,\" Casey said. He called for a Marshall Plan for the children of America, much like the billions of dollars in economic support the U.S. gave to Europe after WWII.\nBush echoed those calls to action, stressing that America’s children need access to these fundamental nutrients as they grow.\n\"The most devastating part is when you are 2 years old and younger, you don’t have a lot of control over your life,\" she said. \"But it can have an impact on your life in perpetuity.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " french fry END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave in France\n\nArticle: In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.\nThese weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They’ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\"\nShe knew that Rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I’m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It’s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.\nAnd if Rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The simple reason the Cavs can't win the NBA title\n\nArticle: The Cavs then saw the simple truth play out twice more in the regular season.\nThen again in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\nAnd again in Game 2 of the NBA Finals Sunday.\nThe Cavaliers have been taught the simple truth seven times now — all Warriors wins — and yet they have not come to the understanding that they cannot take 2s and expect to beat 3s.\nAnd because the lesson has not been learned, another simple truth has come forward: The Cavaliers cannot win these NBA Finals.\nFrankly, they'd be lucky to win a game.\nThe Warriors have now won seven consecutive games against the Cavs — three straight to claim last season's title, twice in the 2015-16 regular season, and now twice in these NBA Finals — and in each effort, the Cavs have found themselves further and further from victory.\nNothing about these Warriors' wins has been flukey. This is what they do. They are prolific and ruthless — a juggernaut of the highest order.\nIf anything, the Warriors have given the Cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: In Game 1, the Splash Brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the Warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. In Game 2, Golden State turned the ball over 20 times.\nThose were windows — the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the Cavs couldn't take advantage of it. The simple truth loomed too large.\nThe Warriors made 15 3-pointers while the Cavs made 5 on Sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point Warriors win — the seventh-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.\nThe Cavs came into Sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the Eastern Conference Playoffs with ease.\nIt was going to be hard — coach Tyronn Lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between Games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the Warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions — but the Cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory.\nInstead, the Cavs shot two more 3-pointers in Game 2 compared to Game 1. They made two fewer. Overall, Cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while J.R. Smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the Finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. The Warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one.\nHow do the Cavs win a game in this series? It certainly appears that it's going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so — the kind of changes that look beyond Lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the \"tougher plays\" as the reasons behind his team's blowout loss Sunday.\nNot being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as LeBron James said in his postgame press conference — 50-50 balls.\nThe Cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in NBA Finals history — the Warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games — and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls.\nIt has to do with the Warriors' elite defense. It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that. It has to do with Cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time.\nIt has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2.\nThe Cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they cannot take 2s and expect to beat 3s END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The future of fast food has arrived and it's a one-of-a-kind experience\n\nArticle: We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.\nEatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience.\nThe tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots.\nInstead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? \nThe concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.\nWhile one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\"\nMuch like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.\nTo the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. \nSince there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth.\nRight before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.\nTBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.\nThe process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.\nThough I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen.\nVery ominous.\nDespite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\"\nFirst-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\"\nAs of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick.\"\nWith the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.\nWhile this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it’s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy. So it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\" \nBryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said.\nHer boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways.\"\nTo get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\"\nNederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned. \nMarsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said. \nThough the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)\n\"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days. We’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said.\nWhat's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " robots END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: You'll Never Guess How Much Money the Marvel Universe Has Grossed\n\nArticle: The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or (MCU) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics. In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.\nIt was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.\nHowever, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that \"these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie...In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.\"\nWith this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:\nPhase One\nIron Man - $585,174,222\nThe Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551\nIron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331\nThor - $449,326,618\nCaptain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774\nThe Avengers - $1,518,594,910\nPhase Two\nIron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910\nThor: The Dark World - $644,783,140\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534\nGuardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600\nAvengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115\nAnt-Man - $518,585,201\nPhase Three\nPhase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.\nAudiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.\nThe Marvel Effect\nAs of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.\nPredicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Most millennials believe student debt is a \"major\" problem—and this is who they blame.\n\nArticle: NEW YORK -- A majority of young Americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem.\nFifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the United States a \"major problem,\" according to survey results released exclusively to The Huffington Post on Tuesday by the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a \"minor problem.\" Yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue.\nA plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school.\nThe cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment. But policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nation's $1.2 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole.\n\"Young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education,\" said Rory O'Sullivan, Policy and Research Director at Young Invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates.\nMatthew Segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit OurTime.org, was \"pleasantly surprised\" to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges.\n\"People are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs,\" Segal said.\nSegal noted that George Washington University, for instance, is currently building a $130 million \"super dorm\" on campus, and students at the University of Pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers. This phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isn't limited to private schools, either: Iowa State University recently spent $46.2 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the University of California-Davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls.\n\"Too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students,\" Segal said.\nHowever, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nation's outstanding student debt. The U.S. Department of Education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone.\nAlthough O'Sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. Only 8 percent of Harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt.\nA 2012 New York Federal Reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. A previous Huffington Post/YouGov poll found most Americans believe state universities are no longer affordable.\n\"We invest less than we used to, per student,\" O'Sullivan noted.\nYoung Invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill. O'Sullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now it's important to explain why student debt is big and \"what it is we need to fix it.\"\nMore than 7 in 10 in the Harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college.\nThe Huffington Post collaborated with the Harvard Institute of Politics on questions asked of college-age Americans. A larger update to Harvard's biennial study of younger Americans will be publicly released Wednesday.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " colleges END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Chinese Father Realizes His Greatest Regret After His Son Dies in Car Accident\n\nArticle: 1 Share Share Tweet Share Share Email\nA father realized one of his biggest regrets after his son’s fatal car crash and is now committed to helping Asian immigrant parents avoid his mistake.\nWhile on a trip to China in June last year, Paul Li received tragic news that his 18-year-old son was one of the victims in a fatal high-speed car wreck. Li, an investment analyst from Rockville, Maryland, had tried convincing his son to join him on his trip to China. According to Washington Post, his son declined his offer and told him:\n\"Dad, don’t worry about me. I will work hard, and I will be successful, and you will be proud of me.\"\nOn June 25, 2015, Sam Ellis left a party in North Potomac where he had been drinking and crashed his car into another vehicle that killed Li’s son, Calvin, and a fellow classmate, Alex Murk. Ellis, a one-time star quarterback at Wootton High School, pleaded guilty on two charges of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison.\nCalvin, an extroverted football player and recent graduate at Wootton High School, had been admitted to the University of Maryland in College Park where he would have attended as a freshman. Friends remember Calvin as a football fanatic who was charismatic, upbeat and funny.\nHe was the wide receiver No. 7 on his high school football team and once had aspirations of becoming a professional football player. Li recalled crushing his son’s dreams during his middle school years when he told Calvin:\n\"Son, you go back to study. You’re not going to be a football player. You are Chinese.\"\nThat moment would become one of his greatest regrets. Li, a Chinese immigrant who arrived to the United States during his twenties, reflected after his son’s passing:\n\"If I knew what I know now, I would’ve been a much better parent.\n\"When I look back, I cannot forgive myself. Even though I know maybe in reality he would not be a football player. But it was just the way I shattered his dream when he was small ... And I know for sure, there are other Chinese parents who are doing the same to their children right now. And I don’t want that to happen.\"\nLi recognized his son’s struggle to reconcile the dual Chinese and American cultures in which he was raised. As a child, Calvin attended Chinese school on the weekends and excelled in Mandarin. However, as he grew up, Calvin began distancing himself from his parents’ cultural traditions and values.\nAs a teenager, Calvin strove to be more Americanized and had no interest in eating out at Chinese restaurants with his parents, listening to Chinese news or traveling to Asia. He wanted to break away from the kind of stereotypes that are linked to Asian Americans such as academic excellence in math and science. Li said:\n\"So his [Calvin’s] way of doing that was to distance himself from anything Chinese. I felt that’s not the right way of dealing with identity, but at the time I was not aware of this issue. I was not understanding enough to help him. I was just forcefully saying, you know, ‘You’re a Chinese kid.’\"\nCalvin associated with few other Asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn’t academics. Li struggled to understand his son’s avoidance of his cultural heritage and desire to adopt an all-American attitude growing up.\n\"Society often thinks, Asian kids — they’re doing well in school, they’re working hard they tend to be overachievers, they don’t have any problems. But in fact, they do have problems, and many of the problems are overlooked by not only their parents but also by the society.\"\nIn March, Li established a foundation name for his son and announced that he will be donating $1.2 million over the span of three years for a University of Maryland fellowship. The fellowship will be dedicated to studying the kinds of issues facing the children of Asian American immigrants involving family dynamics, identity formation and cultural gaps.\nJanelle Wong, the director of Asian American Studies at University of Maryland, believes such families will benefit from the research findings that will be presented at lectures and community workshops.\n(Visited 40,955 times, 1 visits today)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Son, you go back to study.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How did @MileyCyrus beat @Beyonce?!\n\nArticle: On Tuesday (Dec. 17), Google released their top trending and search lists of the year. The Nelson Mandela and the Boston bombing dominated various lists alongside the search for \"What is twerking?\" As for most-searched people of 2013, Miley's favorite activity landed her atop a somewhat predictable list.\nHere are the top 10:\n1. Miley Cyrus\nMiley likely ranked the highest on Google's list because of twerking. She spent 2013 breaking off an engagement, smoking a blunt on stage (at the EMAS), and swinging around on a wrecking ball, naked and crying. You probably missed a lot of important news while all that was happening.\n2. Drake\nDrake is a surprise at second place, especially on a list that also contains the name \"Beyonce.\" Although, the year wasn't without accomplishments for the rapper. He helped Beyonce with \"Beyonce,\" briefly starred in \"Anchorman 2\" and received multiple Grammy nods (despite not showing up for the nominations concert).\n3. Kim Kardashian\nKim Kardashian is almost constantly the subject of rumors -- the most recent of which alleges she waxed North West's eyebrows. On top of the usual obsession with her every move, the woman who is famous for being famous had a baby, received an enormous engagement ring via Jumbotron proposal and made the shockingly unsurprising decision to televise yet another wedding.\n4. Justin Bieber\nLe petit Canadian has been spitting all over the place since early January. He abandoned his pet monkey in Germany, said he hoped Anne Frank \"would have been a Belieber\" and peed in a bucket while insulting a former president. In any case, all of of his antics seem to have tired him out: he announced Dec. 18 that he's \"retiring.\"\n5. Beyonce\nAt number one on Bing's list, Bey surprisingly came in only midway down Google's results. Of all the Bey moments of 2013, the most surprising / awesome / life-changing thing was obviously her surprise visual album (which quickly sold over one million albums and rose to No. 1). The Queen of the Universe doesn't need salacious headlines to keep you talking.\n6. Rihanna\nRihanna made waves when she wore a doobie wrap to the AMAs, at which her mother presented her with the honor of the first-ever Icon Award. The Barbadian also spent 2013 posting various Instagrams of her butt that seemed to culminate in her controversial \"Pour It Up\" video, featuring a denim thong.\n7. Taylor Swift\nAmerica's most famous jam maker faked surprised over a lot of awards in 2013. Earlier in the year, she said some definitely not endearing things about there being a \"special place in hell\" for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, but the 24-year-old was able to make amends by a PR repair that including leaving a very sizable tip and inviting Lorde to her birthday party.\n8. Selena Gomez\nIn 2013, Selena Gomez conducted her \"Stars Dance\" tour after ending things with petit Canadian Justin Bieber. Her personal life also included a scuffle with Lorde, an enduring friendship with with Taylor Swift and lots of short shorts. Gomez briefly came under fire for her MTV movie awards performance, which included the inappropriate use of a bindi as an accessory.\n9. Katy Perry\n\"Roar\" was a huge success for Katy Perry this year. The 29-year-old continued her relationship with John Mayer, which culminated in a very romantic video for their duet \"Who You Love.\" On the negative side of things, a particularly controversial AMA performance and claims of ripping off Sara Bareilles' \"Brave\" left the pop princess with some harsher criticism than she dealt with in the past.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " most-searched people of 2013 END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is the difference between a job and a calling\n\nArticle: I’ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it’s a calling. And often, it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn’t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you.\nGranted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they’re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you’re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, \"What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?\" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward.\nI’ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a \"dream book\" myself, and I’ve filled it with things that are important to me—from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that’s been on my list of projects to tackle—and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today.\nSo spend time creating a vision for your life. Ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. Trust me, your vision can and will change over time. But knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life—in and out of the workplace—is absolutely key to success. And more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: This \"Star Wars\" theory about Rey will blow your mind\n\nArticle: More like Grandpa-lpatine.\nThe conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey's parents?\nWhile many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series.\nBut a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter.\nYouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it's pretty compelling.\nThere's the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move.\nThis mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust.\nRey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental.\nThis cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey's parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now.\nThat's because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark.\nIn the film's script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\".\nDuring Rey's vision, Palpatine can be heard several times.\nRight before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine's scream, and further along, there's audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine's inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke's lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol' Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey?\nThe notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens.\nIn the portrait form, Rey's strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense.\nBut when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they're one.\nFinally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey's British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine.\nThere's even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film's script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter END"}

The practice has long proved popular among A-listers in search of the next best therapy.\nIn 2004, Gwyneth Paltrow appeared at a film premiere revealing the signs of cupping on her back.\nImage copyright LFI Image caption Gwyneth Paltrow with cupping marks in 2004\nJustin Bieber, Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Aniston have all been photographed with what look like cupping marks.\nAnd Nicole Ritchie made her dad, singer Lionel Richie try it - although pictures suggest he might not entirely have enjoyed it.\nCupping has also become an increasingly available and popular treatment in beauty parlours and spas, as well as traditional Chinese medicine shops where it is commonly on offer.\nDoesn't it hurt?\nThe British Acupuncture Council (BAcC) says cupping is not painful, and the red marks left on the skin are caused by blood being drawn to the surface and small capillaries rupturing.\nImage copyright Thinkstock\nOn the other hand, swimmer Michael Phelps was filmed wincing as he underwent the technique in a recent advert , and other Olympians have posted pictures of what look like painful cupping sessions on social media.\nBelarusian swimmer Pavel Sankovich also posted a photo of his legs covered in a dozen of the little domes.\nImage copyright Pavel Sankovich Instagram\nThe BAcC warns that on \"rare occasions\" the hot cups can cause mild burns. It has published rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained practitioners who are accredited members of their organisation.\nSo does it actually work?\nPractitioners claim cupping helps with a huge variety of ailments from muscle problems to cellulite.\nWhile there have \"certainly been satisfied customers for 3,000 years\", Professor Edzard Ernst from the department of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter previously told the BBC it was not a proven medical treatment.\nHe insisted it was a relatively safe practice, but added: \"There is no evidence for its efficacy. It has not been submitted to clinical trials.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " cupping END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Power battle\n\nArticle: This week security forces of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas have arrested dozens of Gaza residents for participating in protests against cuts to the electricity supply. Tensions and anger are now rising in the Gaza Strip as many are without power for more than 18 hours a day.\nThousands of angry demonstrators have poured onto the streets, protesting against both the local electricity company and the Hamas-run Gaza power authority, demanding an immediate solution.\nHamas security forces violently dispersed the protesters, with shots fired in the air to clear the crowds and a number of protesters and local journalists assaulted.\nThe unusual protest near Gaza's most densely populated place - the Jebaliya refugee camp - was one of the largest unauthorised and unplanned protests since Hamas reinforced its power in the strip in 2007, when it removed officials from the Fatah movement.\nSince then, there has effectively been a division of the Palestinian territories, with parts of the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian Authority and its Fatah President, Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza governed by Hamas.\n'Thank God I am still alive'\nA video posted on Facebook shows demonstrators marching from the centre of the refugee camp to the headquarters of the electricity company.\nHamas security forces, some wearing civilian clothes, then began firing live ammunition into the air and hitting civilians with batons.\n\"Thank God I am still alive! I was hit by several punches and blows from the police,\" said Ehab Elmaghraby, a student who took part in the protest.\n\"We were shouting from the beginning, 'Peaceful, peaceful, we need electricity',\" he added.\nFor the last couple of years, people in Gaza receive electricity on alternating eight-hour cycles, but for the last four weeks they have only received a maximum of four hours of power a day from the electricity company - a reduction in supply that has come in the middle of particularly cold weather in Gaza.\nThe two million residents of Gaza require around 470-500 megawatts of power per day, but at the moment are receiving less than half of that, according to the spokesman for the electricity supplier, Tariq Lubbad.\nAbu Ziad Sakallah owns a workshop producing household furnishings and can only work for a couple of hours every day. It's not enough to meet his deadlines for orders received.\n\"I'm no longer able to pay the salaries of my eight workers for the time when we aren't able to work. We are only working for three or four hours a day and this, of course, is not enough,\" Sakallah said.\nHamas' police forces arrested dozens of people in northern Gaza for their involvement in the demonstration.\nThe Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said that \"security personnel in the aftermath of the protest raided several houses and arrested a number of activists\".\nThe Associated Press said that one of its journalists was arrested, while a photographer for the French news agency AFP was reportedly hit in the face by a police officer's gun when he refused to hand over his camera.\nThe foreign press had been told by Hamas not to cover the event. The photographer had to go to hospital and received stitches for a wound on his face.\nOn Friday, the Hamas movement held the government of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah in the West Bank, and President Abbas responsible for the dire electricity crisis in the Gaza Strip.\nHamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhum said that the ongoing power shortage was \"intentional\" and aimed \"to tighten the unfair siege on Gaza and create chaos and anarchy\".\nBarhum demanded that Abbas, and the Fatah movement that he leads, \"end this dangerous policy\" and end the crisis, which has left Gaza with less than a quarter of its required electricity.\nMore than 10 years ago, Israel destroyed a large part of the power plant located in central Gaza after the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants.\nSince then, power shortages have had an impact on almost every aspect of life in Gaza.\nLocal and international organisations have suggested numerous solutions over the past decade to solve the crisis, leading to the reconstruction of the destroyed power station.\nNikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, warned that local residents could not be expected to live with \"just a couple of hours of electricity per day in the middle of winter\".\n\"I call for the full respect of the right to freedom of expression, peaceful protest and assembly in Gaza,\" Mladenov also said in a statement.\n\"All responsible authorities must co-operate to resolve the electricity crisis immediately,\" he added.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This week security forces of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas have arrested dozens of Gaza residents for participating in protests against cuts to the electricity supply END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Do Trees Sleep at Night?\n\nArticle: After a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep?\nIt depends on how you define \"sleep,\" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said.\nIn the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?]\nThe laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said.\nThe silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found.\nTrees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. Credit: Eetu Puttonen\n\"Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,\" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. \"The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].\"\nIt's unclear if the sun \"woke up\" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But \"the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],\" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.\nThe finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said.\nThe famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.\nHowever, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.\nThe tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said.\n\"Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,\" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]\nThe researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. \"This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,\" Puttonen said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It depends on how you define \"sleep,\" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said.

The complaints allege that its upstart rival's cameras can lose about 5 frames per minute. The suits come two weeks after Vievu sued Taser on the claim that the company had illegally lobbied officials in the city of Phoenix to abandon a $3.6 million camera contract that Vievu had recently won.\nThe body-camera war has also included skirmishes in New York City, where Vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by Taser.

But the bank’s real treasures aren’t in some vault, they’re in plain sight—the ADB canteen offers scrumptious meals from several Asian cuisines at affordable prices, as well as a bakery that serves up all kinds of breads, pies, and pastries.\nWhile the bibimbap, tempura bento, and walnut pie might all be worth breaking and entering for, the real crown jewels of the ADB canteen are the chocolate crinkles baked in-house daily. You hear about them—the cookies in that really strict building. They've become a legend on their own, and out of reach. And just like clockwork, a queue forms every day at mid-afternoon for these hockey pucks from heaven.\nTime your appointment just right and fall in line for the chocolate crinkles (P14/piece). While you’re at it, pick up some brewed coffee at just P11 (bring your own tumbler or shell out P10 for a paper cup!) and take your double handful of happiness out to a bench in the courtyard.\nFor the price, these crinkles are huge—each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. Pull a crinkle apart—it’s very dense, and very moist. I love that it’s really more like a half-baked, dollar pancake-shaped brownie than your typical small, dry, boring convenience store crinkle. The surface, lightly dusted with confectioner’s sugar, just barely holds the structure together, and provides a subtle, cookie-like textural contrast to the chewy interiors.\nPop it in your mouth and you’ll find that the dark, bittersweet chocolate is as rich and rewarding as it looks. There’s no doubt that the bakers don’t scrimp on the good stuff. In fact, these crinkles are so decadent, I have trouble finishing more than one at a time. They’re the best I’ve had in Manila because unlike others, they’re well-balanced—the sweetness is just right and isn’t overwhelming, thanks to the good chocolate worked skillfully by the bakers, and the delicate touch taken with the confectioner’s sugar.\nI'd go through ADB's airport-level security just to have it over and over again.\nSo if your work brings you to ADB, share the opportunity presented with a lucky few and grab as many as you can (which is strictly limited to 20 per person—I guess crinkle hoarding is a thing!).\nThe Undercover Eater works with food on a daily basis and hunts for hidden gems in his spare time.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s How To Actually Make Your Penis Bigger\n\nArticle: Just, you know, in case you're wondering.\nWe’re not pointing any fingers here, but apparently lots of people are turning to Google with questions about penis sizes.\nAccording to a recent analysis of Google data by economist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, the top penis-related search was \"how to make my penis bigger.\"\nAt BuzzFeed Health, we're all about helping you achieve your goals. So we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this.\nFirst, let's talk about all those creams, pills, treatments, and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer, stronger boner.\nThey... probably won't work. \"You can only maximize your size to what you’re capable of achieving,\" Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The New Naked, tells BuzzFeed Life.\nEven those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length, and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard, says Fisch. So don’t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches. \"There’s no actual scientific study that they rely on.\"\n\"Here’s the thing,\" says Fisch. \"You can increase the size of your penis — visually. The way you can do it is by losing weight.\"\nThis is not a trap. When you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. \"If you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less,\" says Fisch.\nSo if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. If you're not sure where to start, check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration.\nAnother way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair.\nAgain, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you’re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet.\nThen make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be.\n\"Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can’t get it bigger than that,\" says Fisch. \"However, a lot of men don’t meet their potential.\"\nThat’s usually because they’re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system. \"What’s good for the heart is good for the penis,\" says Fisch.\nAnd OK, yes, there are some pills you can take.\nObviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common. While they won’t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. So if you’re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription.\nSupplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch.\nIt's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. Definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. Don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's Viagra Rx.\nALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn’t worry so much about your size anyway. Seriously.\nFirst of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. The average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch. Chances are, you're actually pretty close to average.\nAnd if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. Many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure.\nNow, let’s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis.\nSure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. But you’ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don’t care either way. It’s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. It's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all).\nBottom line: You can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's OK.\nYes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.'\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " losing weight.\nTrim your pubic hair.\nmake sure your boner is at maximum capacity\nthere are some pills you can take.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice\n\nArticle: Some of my Christian friends tell me they can’t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between \"the lesser of two evils,\" the morally right thing is to choose neither one. They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.\nAs a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.\nAmerican citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other – because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.\nA good candidate with flaws\nI do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.\nI did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors’ conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an \"evil candidate.\" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.\nHe is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don’t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.\nOn the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic – I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him \"a good candidate with flaws\" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.\nSeek the good of the nation\nShould Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are \"exiles\" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon:\n\"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare\" (Jeremiah 29:7).\nBy way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will \"seek the welfare\" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?\nIf this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?\nUnder President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: \"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin\" (James 4:17).\nSome may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: \"On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.\" (Obadiah 1:11).\nI am writing this article because I doubt that many \"I can’t vote for Trump\" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.\nThe Supreme Court with Clinton as president\nHillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.\nBut that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.\nThe nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.\nThat is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.\nEven if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.\nAbortion\nOn abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute \"right to abortion\" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.\nVoters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.\nSo it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: You'll Never Guess What Else Gives You The Munchies\n\nArticle: Until now you thought that your love for marijuana was the reason for your munchies, but you’ll never guess what else can actually give you the munchies. According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.\nJust by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.\nConducting the study\nThe University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.\nAfter the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.\nSleep deprivation and obesity\nIt has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.\nThe scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.\nThe endocannabinoid system\nFinally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.\nEndocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"\nSo it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it.\nDo you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived?

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How To Play Pokémon Go In Your Car Without Mowing Down Trees Or People\n\nArticle: Illustration credit: Sam Woolley\nLet’s get this out of the way: Pokémon Go is meant for walking. But where I live, it’s also upwards of 100 degrees outside right now. And besides, walking? This is America; that’s for suckers. But for those tempted to play the game while driving, it’s proven extremely dangerous. We’ve seen driving players hit trees, and at least two have even hit cop cars—one in Baltimore and another in Montréal.\nhttp://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla...\nSo, if you must catch ‘em all in a car, there are some things that can be done to mitigate the risk of crashing into police, being charged with vehicular manslaughter or just being bad at the game. Here are some rules to follow.\nRule No. 1: Don’t\nDon’t! Just don’t. Let me say this again for good measure: DON’T.\nI know there’s at least one or two of you out there who are thinking, \"Ha! I am a multitasking god! Your mortal rules can not apply to me.\" You can eat a cheeseburger with your knee as you put on make-up with your elbow and steer the car with your chin, and you’ve done it before. That’s the problem.\nSponsored\nI tried catching Pokémon while parked in a drive-thru. Even then, I felt dumb when I didn’t move up immediately because there was a Poliwag in sight. Park somewhere where you’ll stay parked to catch Pokémon.\nPokémon Go requires your full attention. Driving also requires your full attention. Yes, there’s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Pokémon on a backdrop of whatever’s in front of you. Problem is, you’re then focusing on catching the Pokémon instead of the background of reality.\nThe little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It’s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Pokémon. It’s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can’t easily spin around in the driver’s seat if a Pokémon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway.\nSo, keep it in park if you’re going to do anything in the game. You can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car’s interior, but don’t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic.\nSimply put: \"P\" means \"play.\" Or, if you have a manual transmission, don’t even think about playing until you’ve yanked the parking brake.\nParked to figure out my next move.\nRule No. 2: Scope Out Your Next Pokéstop Before Going There\nThe great thing about the Pokémon Go interface is that it gives you a map. You can tap on further away gyms and Pokéstops to see where they are before they’re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you’d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving.\nFind a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car’s navigation unit. Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location. Be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would.\nRule No. 3: Leave Your Phone On, But On Silent And Hidden\nOne big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you’re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who’s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes.\nFortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Pokémon. Once you have your next Pokéstop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. Then you’ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of Magikarp.\nhttp://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla...\nHow to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a Porsche 918 Spyder.\nIf you’re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. Out of sight, out of mind. If you know you’ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. If you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk.\nI will say that my fear of becoming That Guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing Pokémon Go has made me a less distracted driver. With the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. I simply don’t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel.\nOne of many landmarks you’ll find as Pokéstops in the game.\nRule No. 4: Get Out And Walk Around Anyway\nI’m always looking for shortcuts. So, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands—or laps on a race track—to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan.\nNope. The app was one step ahead of that idea. After my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, I wondered what was up.\nTurns out, there’s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. While I couldn’t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on Quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph—which sounds about right.\nBecause you have to drive safely, we don’t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. That’s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road.\nIt’s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don’t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. There are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars.\nIf you’re playing around cars, make sure they’re going to stay parked for a while. Inside Petrol Lounge, Austin.\nRather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. See your city’s landmarks. If you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it.\nPick Pokéstops that coincide with other errands you have to do. My usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. That’s convenient! I’m out of my car anyway and it’s a place I don’t mind hanging out for a little while.\nOnce you’re at a stop and have caught all the new Pokémon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new Pokéstop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Don’t Don’t!

That's because Scarlett Johansson -- who co-stars with Joaquin Phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\nJonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional.\n\"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.\n\"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality.

Johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation.\nFor what it's worth, Warner Bros. and \"Her\" producer Megan Ellison are planning a full-court press for Johansson's awards campaign.

Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success.\nMore recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European.\nThe fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The fascinating tradition that sets baseball apart\n\nArticle: There are several competing theories as to why, in the middle of the seventh inning, every baseball game comes to a stop so everyone can stretch, sing a really old song and take a breather. But for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique.\nHere are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment.\nTHE MUSIC\nAside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films.\nTHE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS\nThe origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit.\nAnother theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof.\nPresident William Howard Taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in Washington in April of 1910. (Photo by Mark Rucker/Transcendental Graphics, Getty Images)\nTHE CAMARADERIE\nDave Ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of \"Beyond the Cheers,\" believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything.\n\"It's actually taken on its own life, depending on the team,\" Ferguson told HuffPost. \"The players look at it as a break from the game itself. And it's appreciated by the fans.\"\nTony La Russa: \"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history.\" (AP)\nTHE TRADITION\n\"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history,\" Tony La Russa, the three-time World Series-winning manager, told The Huffington Post. La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay.\nTHE RELIEF\nBaseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies.\nIchiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.\nAnd the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Crazy Cooking Hack that Slashes the Calories in Rice by Half\n\nArticle: Whether you think rice is a friend or foe to your diet, there's one thing we can all agree on: It's delicious. (If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool—they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more.\nNew research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent.\nLike I said: Seriously cool.\nThe researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch—one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body.\nThis is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body.\nBonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found.\nNo word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. For now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent END"}

Cats nip and nibble at us all the time, but it’s far from an aggressive gesture. Cats do the same when they’re grooming their kittens, so it’s much more likely that they think of you with the same affection.\n8. Much like with head-butting, cats will run between your legs to mark you with their scent.\n9. If you can get your cat purring, it means that they’re very happy with you and with what you’re doing.\n10. It may be annoying sometimes, but when your cat follows you absolutely everywhere from room to room, it’s just a sign that they like you and want to be where you are.\nSee? Cats aren’t really evil.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This U.S. city is welcoming veterans with an innovative new program\n\nArticle: Fred Johnson is effusive.\nAfter a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves.\nI can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville.\n\"You’ve gotta come, dude -- it’s awesome,\" Johnson told me. \"This is an up-and-coming town.\"\nBut Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program.\nLast year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world.\nThose Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families.\nVisions of America/Getty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline.\nUntil recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville.\nSo in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that.\nThe program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers.\nWhere Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017.\nFilling A Void\nThe transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army’s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world.\nThe Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with \"everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a résumé and job preparation.\"\nConnecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army’s work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site.\nWhere Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com.\nIn addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of \"regional veteran connectors\" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues.\nI’m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program\nHerd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox.\n\"The Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get ‘em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation,\" Herd said. \"The preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. I’m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community.\"\nThe feeling is mutual. For Kentucky’s business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking.\n\"As economic developers, workforce is a challenge,\" said Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of Where Opportunity Knox. \"We have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we’ve gotten past the recession, we’re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills.\"\nThe population of the greater Louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the Great Recession.\nUnemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today. That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today.\nDaniel Marans Retired Col. Walter Herd is director of the Army's Transition Assistance Program.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. The city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector.\nLouisville proper is home to UPS’ Worldport air hub, as well as two Ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant Humana. And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker’s Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.\nArmy veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region’s businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist.\nFor one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place.\nSoldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science.\nBut more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the \"attributes\" that service instills, Herd said. Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox’s walls to return to the civilian world.\nAnd those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators.\n\"The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble,\" Herd said. \"So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.\"\nThe military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program\nThe Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative\nPickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army’s training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas.\nIt is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation.\n\"What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn’t happen somewhere else,\" Pickett said.\nTo Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn’t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS?\n\"I wish every American could go through there,\" Pickett said. \"I was just inspired by it.\"\nDaniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox.\nTranslating \"Army-Speak\" To \"Corporate-Speak\"\nGiven how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate.\nBut unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers.\nIn 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.)\nThe reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers’ stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects.\nThere are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military’s separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Louisville, Kentucky\nWhere Opportunity Knox END"}

Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park.\n\"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\"\nOn Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League.\nBut it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run.\nJudge’s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge.\n\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"\nStarlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP. He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now.\n\"He is the first guy,\" Castro said. \"I’m really happy we are in the same group. It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\"\nMatt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge’s power.\n\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ... I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"\n\"There aren’t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any,\" Holliday said. \"Obviously, Stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that I’ve played against. Barry Bonds, too.\"\nHolliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest.\nMark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic.\n\"Judge’s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst.\nIn 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far.\n\"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. He is exactly where you would hope he would be when I saw him a few years ago.\"\nIt's early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can’t miss. His power, like Bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away. He's the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Aaron Judge END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: According To Science, This Is The Most Addictive Food In The World\n\nArticle: We all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? Iulian Valentin/Shutterstock\nIf processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.\n\"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE\nThe authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.\n\"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write.\nTo test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.\nUnsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs.\nThe respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected.\nChocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries.\nHowever, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods – all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both – were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these.\nStrangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza’s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " pizza END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 8 countries where $200,000 in retirement savings will last 30 years\n\nArticle: © Provided by Investopedia Retiring abroad certainly has its benefits, such as less costly healthcare, a refreshing change of scenery and a lower cost of living. That last detail is especially important for retirees who haven't saved as much as they had hoped. Fortunately, there are a number of countries where you can retire comfortably with a smaller nest egg. Living on the cheap is even easier when you're receiving Social Security benefits. As of 2016, the retirement plan, that, along with your Social Security payments, should be enough to last three decades in the following eight international locales.\n1. Ecuador © Gabrielle & Michel Therin-Weise/Getty Images Expatriates flock to Ecuador because of its gorgeous landscape, superior healthcare system and the generous government benefits extended to retirees, including discounts on utilities and public transportation. Housing is a steal in the capital city of Quito, with the monthly rent for a furnished, 900-square-foot apartment start at just $538. Utilities run $53 a month on average. Overall, Ecuador has a cost of living that's 58% cheaper than New York City.\n2. Nicaragua © Tan Yilmaz/Getty Images Nicaragua is located in the heart of Central America, and it's a premier retirement destination if you're looking for an excellent quality of life without a high price tag. The Nicaraguan government offers a number of financial incentives to attract foreign retirees, such as a sales tax exemption on construction materials if you're building a home. You need to be at least 45 years old and have a minimum monthly income of $600 to qualify, which may be appealing if you're considering an early retirement. It's one of The 7 Best Countries for Retiring in Latin America .\n3. Thailand © Ingolf Pompe/LOOK-foto/Getty Images If you're looking for somewhere a little more exotic, it doesn't get much better than Thailand. savings account. Bangkok is one of Thailand’s pricier cities, but even so, it's still 50%–60% cheaper than Chicago, New York or Boston.\n4. Belize © Kelley Miller/National Geographic RF/Getty Images Palm trees, blue skies and sandy beaches are some of the best reasons to retire in Belize, as is the fact that it's extremely budget-friendly. Housing in Belize City is dirt cheap, with a 900-square-foot furnished rental going for as little as $377 a month. The Qualified Retired Persons Incentive Program makes it even more attractive for retirees age 45 and up since any income earned from sources outside Belize is 100% tax-free.\n5. Panama © Susan Leggett/Alamy Panama proves to be exceptionally welcoming for retirees from all parts of the globe who come in search of a tropical atmosphere. Prices in Panama City tend to be on par with what you'd pay in the U.S., but you'll find that the surrounding smaller towns and villages are much more affordable. The Pensionado Program saves foreign retirees some extra cash by offering discounts on flights, hospital services, utilities and more.\n6. Costa Rica © billberryphotography/Getty Images Costa Rica is popular with tourists, but certain areas, such as the Central Valley region and the southern coast, are ideally suited for establishing permanent residence on a shoestring. Even if you decide to set up shop in the capital city of San Jose, rental prices can go as low as $417 per month or up to $1,042, depending on the neighborhood. Utilities typically run between $48 and $79 per month, so it's definitely possible to make your retirement savings stretch.\n7. Malaysia © Richard I'Anson/Getty Images Malaysia's people are just as warm as the weather, and this is the kind of place where outsiders are easily welcomed into the fold. As far as the cost of living goes, Malaysia is roughly 44% cheaper than the U.S. Housing is an especially good deal, with rent prices that are 69% lower than what you'd find here at home. Retirees can apply for a long-term visa through the Malaysia My Second Home Program. If you're 50 or older, you'll need at least 350,000 Malaysian ringgits ($89,343 USD) in assets and 10,000 Malaysian ringgits ($2,552 USD) in monthly income.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The terrifying way not sleeping enough actually changes your gut\n\nArticle: Studies link insufficient sleep to some pretty scary consequences, including an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and even some cancers.\nExperts still don’t fully understand why not getting enough sleep is connected to all of these conditions, but new research published this month adds one piece to the puzzle: Not getting enough sleep may cause changes to gut bacteria that could fundamentally change our metabolism, affecting a host of bodily systems.\nGut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms living in our intestines that help keep our metabolism, immune system and other bodily functions running normally, explained senior study author Jonathan Cedernaes, a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden. Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.\nThis new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained. \nThe researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours.\nThe study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. Plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone’s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level.\nThe data showed that getting less sleep didn’t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. But getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. The amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent ― and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep.\nThe finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, Cedernaes explained. \nWhat’s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night’s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases.\n\"Gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies,\" Cedernaes said. \"[They] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. They can also help us extract nutrients.\" \nThere was yet another interesting finding from the study. The individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep ― a potential diabetes risk ― compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer. \nSleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, Cedernaes said. And while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes. \nAdditional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. But the new data makes a strong case, Cedernaes said ― a strong case for catching your Zs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 9 ways the new \"Beauty and the Beast\" is different from the original\n\nArticle: As everyone returned to work Monday morning, it’s safe to assume rooms were buzzing with discussions about the highly anticipated \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake that debuted over the weekend.\nSome may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic.\nSo how did the remake compare to the original?\nWell, that’s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: There were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released \"Beauty and Beast\" a completely different feel from the original.\nQuestions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own.\nHere’s a look at nine ways the \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake differed from the original:\nWarning: This post contains spoilers.\nIn the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she’s also a teacher and inventor.\nIt’s clear Belle is one of the only literate women in town. While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle’s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she’s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so.\nShe held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town.\nIn the original \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the audience simply knows \"crazy Maurice\" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle’s mother was or what happened to her.\nBut thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It’s \"much smaller\" than Belle imagined. It’s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother.\nAfter spotting a doctor’s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle’s mother died from the plague. A flashback between Maurice and Belle’s mom (Zoe Rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. The woman tells Maurice to take Belle away so she doesn’t catch the disease as well. So he does, and the rest is history.\nThe Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn’t always that way. In the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the Beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. In the remake, we found out that’s not entirely the case.\nWhile Belle asks Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the Beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never \"protected\" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a \"Beast\" well before his physical transformation.\nIt’s true. Lyrics to one of the movie’s most popular songs, \"Gaston,\" sounded a little different than the original. While they were new to moviegoers, \"Beauty and the Beast\" composer Alan Menken said they weren’t technically \"new\" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late Howard Ashman that didn’t make the cut in the original film.\n\"[They’re] not actually new lyrics, they’re actually Howard Ashman’s that were outtake things,\" Menken told ComicBook prior to the premiere in Los Angeles. \"We had also put some of the outtake lyrics from Howard in the Broadway show. And the reason that they hadn’t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy.\"\nFor example, the added lyric \"I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver and I shoot in the liver\" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, Menken said it was perfect.\nUnlike in the original, the new Beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting Shakespeare and critiquing Belle’s admiration for \"Romeo and Juliet.\"\nThis is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate Beast needed Belle’s help sounding out words in the books. The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn’t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point.\nWhat happened to Mrs. Potts’ children, Chip’s brothers and sisters? While Chip (Nathan Mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn’t alone.\nIn the original film, Mrs. Potts told Chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. This time around, Chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. We assume, this time around, he’s Mrs. Potts’ only child.\nNot cool, Gaston (Luke Evans). While trying to win the affection of his \"future father-in-law,\" Gaston pretends to believe Maurice’s warning that a strange Beast has taken his daughter, Belle, captive. So he and LeFou (Josh Gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking Maurice to lead the way.\nWhen Maurice approaches the path to the Beast’s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it’s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice’s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves.\nLeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him...\nThe live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake made history by featuring Disney’s first-ever \"exclusively gay moment.\" In the new film, Josh Gad’s character, LeFou -- Gaston’s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version.\n\"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,\" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. \"He’s confused about what he wants. It’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings.\"\nAt one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn’t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he’s \"too clingy.\" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston’s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup.\nIn the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there’s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before \"the last petal falls,\" referring to the enchanted rose.\nAnd in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. Belle take a long pause before finally telling the Beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek.\nBehind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the Beast and his castle. As she overhears Belle’s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the Beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. The enchantress then disappears without a trace. \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she’s also a teacher and inventor.\nIt was never clear who Belle’s mother was or what happened to her.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The magic word this researcher says can get people to agree with you\n\nArticle: (Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post; iStock)\nA new national poll about how American voters perceive Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton asked: Who between the presidential front-runners has higher moral standards?\nClinton leads Trump in this ambiguous category, 47 percent to 36 percent, according to the results. The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn't elaborate on what \"moral\" encompasses.\nThat could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality.\nIn the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won’t be swayed because I’m standing up for what’s right.\nThe researchers wanted to see if a person’s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be \"moral.\" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants.\n[How Democratic and Republican morals compare to the rest of the world]\nLuttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. Next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed \"feedback\" on their opinions. Some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected \"tradition.\" Others heard their ideas projected \"morality.\"\nLike this:\n\"While your thoughts were similar to other students' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student.\"\nSimply telling someone their attitude was moral, Luttrull found, gave it more power. Compared to those in the \"tradition\" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they’d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. They marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine:\nIn the next two experiments — one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults — researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling.\nThe group’s consensus: Recycling is generally a good thing. After respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. Some heard their views were \"practical.\" Others heard \"moral.\"\nThen the researchers tried to change everyone’s mind. They slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution.\nPeople's attitudes in the \"morality\" group and \"practicality\" group didn't significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. But afterward, a post-test revealed the \"moral\" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the \"practical\" respondents (6.88).\n\"Those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality,\" the authors wrote.\nThe takeaway, according to Luttrell: Framing a cause as \"moral\" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. Any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we'll be probably fighting about politics forever.\n\"Is moral a magic word?\" he said. \"In some ways, it might be. We grow up thinking morality is this thing that's untouchable. What's moral is permanent and cannot be challenged.\"\nFresh off his Vatican visit, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders visits a church in Brooklyn and says income inequality isn't just a political issue, it's a moral issue.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the best possible name for that show\n\nArticle: Today is publication day for TV (THE BOOK): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time, the anthology where Matt Zoller Seitz and I rank the top 100 American sitcoms and dramas ever, and write essays about them, and a whole lot of other things (movies, miniseries, current shows, shows that weren't top 100-worthy but were sentimental favorites in some way, etc.). You can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by Matt and me) at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Google Play, Kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller.\nWe're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, The Ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on Deadwood, while Matt's home base at Vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, The Simpsons(*).\n(*) Maybe my favorite section of the book – and the favorite of many of the early reviewers – is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place.\nIncluded below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place – alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life – among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out...\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997–2001; UPN, 2001–2003) Total score: 94\nTV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...)\nNow, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success.\nExcept maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy.\nWould a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer.\nWhedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make.\nYou could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied.\nIt was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it.\nIf anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion?\nIn the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full.\nTurning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world).\n(Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.)\nBack to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\"\nWhedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.\nAnd it was.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy.

It causes 4 types of cancer!\n\nArticle: Hot dogs are probably the most popular fast-food ever, as they have over 7 billion consumers in the world. However, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.Hot dogs were introduced by German immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts than in the traditional hot dogs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hot dogs END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The 10 Professions With the Most Psychopaths\n\nArticle: You, like most people, probably want to avoid psychopaths . How do you steer clear? Well, if you've ever watched a horror movie, you'll know to stay out of dark woods, unlit alleyways, and to never, ever go into the basement to investigate that strange noise down there. Oh, and you should probably also avoid prison.\nBut, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. Psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday. Research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies\nThese folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions.\nAccording to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent PsyBlog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population . According to research done by psychologist Kevin Dutton called the Great British Psychopath Survey, some jobs seem to attract them and have higher than average numbers of psychopaths among their practitioners. And sorry, business leaders, you're not going to like which gig tops the list:\nCEO Lawyer Media (TV and radio) Salesperson Surgeon Journalist Police officer Clergyperson Chef Civil servant\nSome of these are more surprising than others. Who would have guessed the clergy are prone to psychopathy, for instance? Though, I guess, upon reflection, you could see how a job regarded as especially holy might attract those obsessed with their own importance. And I am, of course, personally shocked to see journalists here. (I look around at colleagues with newly suspicious eyes.) Also, how did politician not make the list?\nThe other end of the scale is also interesting but perhaps offers fewer puzzlers. PsyBlog also offers a list of those jobs least likely to be taken by psychopaths, and, as you'd expect, most are intensely focused on empathizing with or caring for others.\nCare aide Nurse Therapist Craftsperson Beautician or stylist Charity worker Teacher Creative artist Doctor Accountant\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " CEO\nLawyer\nMedia\nSalesperson\nSurgeon END"}

In our culture, this herb is known as rosemary.\nth century. The rosemary is great for regulating the high blood pressure and for repairing digestive problems. This remedy is also used for numerous other diseases, such as heart problems, and was especially used in wines by Hungarian Queen Isabella in the 14century.\nThe Queen was 72 years old and was dealing with gout. When she started using the rosemary as a medicine, she discovered immediate results and her skin became so much younger that even the Prince of Poland considered marrying her.\nAccording to research the magnificent rosemary is an amazing antioxidant, full of flavonoids which improve the circulation, regulate the thyroid’s work and alleviates headaches. The rosemary has been particularly useful in cosmetics for encouraging hair growth.\nIf you are suffering from stomach issues or crams, the rosemary will fix them immediately. Studies confirm that this herb positively affects the weight loss process as well, by burning fat effectively.\nOne study, published in 1995 discovered that rosemary can destroy body toxins and act as a genuine diuretic.\nFurthermore, rosemary is able to prevent all sorts of inflammation, from bronchitis to ear, nose and throat infections. If you use rosemary externally and combine it with oil, it will relieve symptoms of sciatica, rheumatic pain and muscle soreness.\nSince it stimulates the circulation so well, the rosemary accentuates the hair growth and prevents dandruff and hair loss. The rosemary is not for oral use nor should it be given to children. Also, pregnant women are advised to consult their doctor before using it. Usually, small amounts in meals and while cooking are allowed.\nYou can always prepare tea from the rosemary leaves and flowers which will calm the organism and help it relax.\nMoreover, rosemary can annihilate symptoms of depression and reduce menstrual cramps significantly.\nTo use the rosemary to its best, here are two recipes that will help you:\nTake a teaspoon of fresh or dried rosemary and cover it with one cup of boiling water. Leave liquid to steep for 15 minutes and then strain with gauze.\nTake two cups per day, in the mornings and in the afternoon. Night dosage is not recommended since it can disturb the sleep.\nRosemary tincture: Mix 1⁄2 cup medicinal alcohol with 1 tablespoon of rosemary leaves. Allow mixture to soak for 10 days, and then strain with gauze.\nTake 15 to 20 drops mixed in a glass of water every day. You can also use it externally to treat rheumatism and hair loss.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Look who just launched a new free streaming-music service:\n\nArticle: Playing catch up to music rivals Spotify and Pandora, Google unveiled a free ad-supported version of its Play Music All Access streaming service Tuesday.\nUsers will be able to listen to curated radio stations based on genre, mood, decade or activity. They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music.\nGoogle's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers.\nTuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple’s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period.\nApple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates.\nGoogle, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. But Google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels.\nOn Google Music, Swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. The album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version.\nSpotify and Pandora’s streaming services — both free and paid — have a big head start on Google. As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn’t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year.\nIn comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers.\nGoogle’s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks.\nSome of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. Songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to Pandora and Spotify, which are automated.\nGoogle says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Google END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: From chili to mustard, how to turn 8 classic ingredients into bulge-beating superfoods\n\nArticle: You might be familiar with the notion that eating foods that are high in calories along with a lack of physical activity causes an imbalance in metabolism, which leads to obesity.\nThe tricky thing, for many of us, is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight.\nHowever, the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from person-to-person, varying in efficiency and requiring differing amounts of energy to process the foods and drinks consumed.\nWouldn't it be fabulous to be able to eat foods that can help you lose weight, simply by eating them? Although this doesn't quite make sense on first reading, you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that.\nResearch suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism, due to their thermogenic effect on the body - in other words, the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food.\nAll foods, when consumed, speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract, using up energy and producing heat in the process. This is known as thermogenesis.\nHowever, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories. The harder the food is to digest, the more calories the body will have to burn to fully break it down, before it can absorb the nutrients from it.\nThermogenesis kicks in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calories many hours after a meal is eaten.\nThe thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet as a whole.\nAn effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic foods to help you to achieve your goals, but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved as part of a balanced diet.\nWith this in mind, here are eight foods that can have a thermogenic effect on your body:\n1. CHILI PEPPERS\nCapsaicin, a compound in chilli peppers, stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat. In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat.\nA 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells.\nUse fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals.\n2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES\nComplex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down.\nThe extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods.\nIt is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage.\nThese vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre. As with complex carbohydrates, these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds.\nSo, aim to reach your seven-a-day, of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits. Choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears.\n3. BLACK PEPPER\nPiperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells.\nSo, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal.\n4. GINGER\nGinger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. Eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production.\nStudies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight. Use it in stir-fries, curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea. Slice into thick discs and add hot water, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.\nGinger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced, ready to use in a tea.\n5. GARLIC\nLike ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost.\n6. MUSTARD\nMustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten.\nAdd in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour.\n7. GREEN TEA\nStudies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body.\nTherefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity.\n8. PROTEIN\nWhen compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect. Proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process.\nFor example, if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories, around 30 percent (i.e. 100 calories) will be burned during digestion.\nResearch has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain, in part also due to its positive effect on post-meal hunger and desire to eat.\nAlways ensure good protein with every meal or snack, not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full. Vegetarian protein sources include quinoa, beans, brown rice and lentils.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. CHILI PEPPERS\n2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES\n3. BLACK PEPPER\n4. GINGER\n5. GARLIC END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This university has more NCAA championships than black male freshmen\n\nArticle: The black students at University of California, Los Angeles, sent a strong message about diversity at their school. Namely, the fact that there isn't much when it comes to African-American males, a troubling fact for one of the state's most elite institutions.\nA group of students, led by Sy Stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. Stokes, a third-year Afro-American studies student who identifies as black, Cherokee and Chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue.\nAccording to the school's enrollment statistics, African-Americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. In the video, Stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. Of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black.\nIn an interview with the Daily Bruin, Stokes said he almost dropped out of UCLA during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. Although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on Nov. 30.\n\"We had to do something to put our issues on the map,\" Stokes said.\nIn an email statement to the school paper, Janina Montero, vice chancellor of student affairs, said administrators acknowledge the need for more diversity and are attempting to work within the state's admission parameters.\n\"We certainly recognize that the low numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented students on campus does lead to a sense of isolation and invisibility,\" Montero said in her email statement. \"It is difficult to eliminate this painful imbalance without considering race in the admissions process.\"\nThe state of California voted down affirmative action in 1996 and passed Proposition 209, which banned state schools from considering race, gender, ethnicity or national origins in their admissions processes. Black student enrollment has severely decreased since that provision and critics are saying that has to change.\nThe students' video adds to the ongoing affirmative action debate both inside and outside of the state, raising awareness about diversity at institutions around the country. Stokes said he feels responsible for spreading the word about the unknown challenges of being a minority student at UCLA and the ongoing lack of diversity on campus.\n\"Being the cousin of Arthur Ashe, I feel as though it is my responsibility to uphold the strong voices of the Black Bruin community,\" he said.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: If you leave your kids alone, it’s not predatory strangers who are a risk\n\nArticle: Once, when she was in about the first grade, she even found a snake. \"There’s no way I would have picked up a snake in front of my parents,\" she says. \"The reason I knew it was OK was I had also gone by myself to the library to take a snake safety class.\" (Yes, a snake safety class.)\n\"You can pretend you’re the Queen of Sheba,\" she says.\nPlaying on her own let her imagination soar.\nAs a child, Ashley Thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in Ojai, California.\nAh, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services!\nOnly in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S.\nA doctoral student in cognitive science at the University of California at Irvine, Thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what’s going on.\nAfter all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low.\nThe chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually.\nIt’s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car.\nNews reports and crime shows feed exaggerated fears.\nThomas and her co-authors note that legal norms needn’t follow inaccurate beliefs about risks.\n\"The fact that many people irrationally fear air travel does not result in air travel being criminalized,\" they write.\n\"Parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes.\n\"In contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult,\" they note.\nIndeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks.\n\"When you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don’t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you,\" Thomas says.\nYou don’t think about whether the store you’re taking your child into might get held up.\nNor should you.\nYet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation.\nWhat’s going on?\nThe researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting.\nTo separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1⁄2-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching Frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. The reasons for the parent’s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover.\nBecause the child’s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical.\nAsked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident.\nThe unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn’t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade.\nBut survey respondents didn’t see things this way at all.\n\"A mother’s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother’s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother’s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write.\nThe same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally.\nMoral disapproval informed beliefs about risks.\nThat was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral).\nPeople rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment.\n\"People don’t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write.\n\"They also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous.\n\"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\"\nThe result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse.\nThese beliefs don’t just affect busybodies.\nThey lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks.\nTake what happened to Julie Koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an Evanston, Illinois, Starbucks for three minutes. When she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying. She rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there.\nKoehler is a public defender in the homicide division. She knew she hadn’t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene.\nShe wasn’t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation.\nOfficials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician’s exam, demanded that Koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications.\n\"What if I was taking an anti-depressant? Would that have affected the outcome of the case?\" she asks.\nThe investigation determined that the report of abuse was \"unfounded.\"\nBut it taught Koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances.\nThe real stranger danger doesn’t come from would-be kidnappers.\nIt comes from people who think they’re doing good.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " busybodies END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Expect Hillary to do this almost immediately if she wins in November\n\nArticle: July 1, 2016 | Nick Bernabe\n(ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees. The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be.\nHillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband’s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi’s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen.\nThe only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East.\nClinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" – the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon.\nSo, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel’s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel’s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States\nHer advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to.\nBut, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\"\nDespite Clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support.\nYet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran’s number one enemy in the US political establishment.\nThe cliché in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it.\nIn May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box.\nThen, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not.\nAfter Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices.\nIn an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons.\nEven though Clinton’s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran’s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran.\nAlthough Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don’t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " new wars in the Middle East END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What Will Make The Future Of Energy Terrorist-Proof?\n\nArticle: David Amster-Olszewski has a distinctive perspective on the future of energy. He’s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is \"choice.\"\n\"What we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,\" says David. \"It’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.\"\nSunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill.\n\"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years. You’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\"\nYet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power.\n\"The challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You’re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It’s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It’s that much of a difference. So you’re working with this industry that’s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force.\"\nAs he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output.\n\"I think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off. You can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\"\nEnergy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. \"It’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Wondering if you can get pregnant during a pregnancy? 🤔  Dr Karl has the answer for you. #science\n\nArticle: Can humans become pregnant while already pregnant? It's possible, but rare.\nCan a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? In other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development?\nThe technical term for this is superfetation. In humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon.\nTwo thousand years ago, that great Greek thinker Aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare.\nAristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares.\nIt was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then — while pregnant — had conceived a second time.\nThere was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, Aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. And he was right.\nNormally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant.\nThe first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg.\nDr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation.\nThe second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg.\nThird, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall.\nEven so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. About 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the Australian swamp wallaby.\nSuperfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature.\nA typical case is that of Julia Grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from Arkansas.\nMs Grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child.\nBut amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 — a few weeks apart. The Daily Mail claimed that, in a \"desperate and final attempt to have children of their own\", the couple had given it one last try.\nThis is a curious use of the word desperate.\nPossible superfetation has been observed in cows\nI might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as \"a desperate and final attempt\" to get pregnant.\nIt makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate.\nAnyhow, Ms Grovenburg was pregnant — but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac. But one was much larger and more developed than the other.\nAs the ultrasounds scans mounted up for Ms Grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other.\nIn other words, Mrs Grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first.\nNow we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. We would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that.\nThese scans would need to document a series of changes — starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks.\nPeople don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get.\nBut there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation. Female European brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant. This means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season.\nFor humans, more babies each breeding cycle isn't always a plus — especially if you're trying to get a good night's sleep.\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.\nIt's a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while it's rare, it can happen.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The technical term for this is superfetation.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How should publishers and news organizations utilize the text messaging medium?\n\nArticle: Facebook Messenger weaves chatbots with friends\n\"Facebook is a bit like that big dog galloping toward you in the park,\" said the late New York Times journalist David Carr, bemoaning the influence the social media giant has had on publishers’ distribution—and, in turn, monetization. \"More often than not, it’s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you.\"\nNow, Facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging.\nBBC uses Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play\nFacebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide. As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It’s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it’s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider’s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps—WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp—have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps—Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram—in their aggregate monthly active users.\nThis rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that’s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp.\nSo, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it.\nWhy Messaging Is Different\nText messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email.\nText messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time.\nAlso, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list.\nThis focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful.\nCost Center or Revenue Stream?\nPublishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising.\nBy virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data.\nBy virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites.\nThis unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages.\nSince preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you \"like\" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again.\nEditorial Experiments\nBefore monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts.\nWhile easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a \"brand building initiative.\" Since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text.\nIn taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion.\nThe Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case.\nAs in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to.\nChatbots\nWhile potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news.\nIn the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story.\nForbesbot on Telegram\nCNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., \"Kasich\") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons They Lost Their Value\n\nArticle: Few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment. Unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come.\nAt one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. Whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the Declaration of Independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered.\nAfter all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt?\nThat dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations.\nFor the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. No matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place.\nYet perception often lags. When it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. What drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to Earth? To understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think.\n10. Coca-Cola Memorabilia\nAs Jim Griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for eBay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. First and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand.\n\"It would be a mistake,\" he said, \"not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically.\"\nThat particular rule hit the market for Coca-Cola collectibles hard.\nBack in the 1940s and 1950s, America seemingly couldn't get enough of Coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. (Contrary to popular rumor, however, the Smith & Wesson Coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) Prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white TV tray they could.\nThis also brought prices tumbling back down when those \"collectibles\" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. Today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those Coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller's lucky.\n9. Americana\nWith Americana popular around the same time as Coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: Smallville, U.S.A. houses decorated from front to back with American flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. Americana collectors slept under Uncle Sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames.\nToday? Not so much.\n\"The frenzy of buying American collectibles and American antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn,\" Griffith said.\nAs with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. While prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. In fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. As Marsha Dixey, consignment director with Heritage Auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. Collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get.\n\"What things don't have a value anymore that people think should,\" she said. \"is one of those things that's totally driven by the collector group that's no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace.\"\nBy the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts.\n8. Roseville Pottery\nWhere supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. It's what wiped out collectors of Roseville Pottery, and it will be back later on this list.\nFor years, Roseville Pottery was a collecting craze. While the company itself went out of business in 1954, Roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. Whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every Roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof.\nUntil the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot.\n\"One of the things that eBay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market,\" Griffith said. \"Suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. Prior to the internet and sites like eBay, I could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. With the internet, I could connect to every piece of Roseville in the world.\"\nWhat the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. A piece was as valuable as the supply of Roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. When the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. When shoppers can go home and Google up 800 more, not so much...\n7. Thomas Kinkade Paintings\nAnother success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the '80s and '90s, Thomas Kinkade, the \"Painter of Light,\" was absolutely everywhere.\nNow, to a degree, Kinkade's work was value-driven. His paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. Yet Kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million IPO in 1994.\nBy its peak, Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010.\nWhat happened? A combination of the two factors we've already discussed: market glut and the internet. As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- \"local scarcity\" as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T.K.S. Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time.\n6. Hummel Figurines\nMost people have heard the name \"Hummel\" before. One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years.\nHummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel. After GI's returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there.\nOver the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model. Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place.\nLike with Thomas Kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights.\n5. Comic Books\nIf flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper.\nThe reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. It is often, he said, about a \"shared cultural moment.\" Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation.\nA collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

He said he and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also working for an overall truce in Syria.\nThe Russian leader said that once the Syrian army secures control of all of Aleppo, civilians will be able to return to their homes.\nIt was not immediately clear if western-backed Syrian opposition would accept such a location for peace talks with Mr Assad’s government. A Turkish official said his country’s aid organisations are helping Syrians who have been evacuated from Aleppo to a border area held by the opposition in Syria’s Idlib province.\nDeputy prime minister Veysi Kaynak said on Friday that \"20 buses from Aleppo have reached the safe zone under control of the Free Syrian Army in Idlib\". He said 30-35 injured people were being treated at the Sahra hospital just over the border.\nMr Kaynak said there had been a discussion with Syrian opposition forces over the possibility of establishing a centre \"within a security zone in Syria\". He told the private Dogan news agency that \"Idlib has no physical capacity to accommodate so many people\".\nHe estimated there are 80,000 to 100,000 individuals who would like to leave Aleppo under the ceasefire deal which Turkey helped broker.\nHe added that Turkey is willing to provide assistance to \"legitimate\" Syrian opposition groups to help meet their needs.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Surprising Thing You Never Have To Do In Watch Dogs 2\n\nArticle: The Surprising Thing You Never Have To Do In Watch Dogs 2 By Dirk Libbey There's a lot to do inside the San Francisco of Watch Dogs 2. However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Pikachu Just Got A New Name And People Are P****d!\n\nArticle: Well, I guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.\nWith Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:\nNow Nintendo wants to unify them: Pokémon in Greater China will be officially called 精靈寶可夢, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Pokémon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was 寵物小精靈 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was 神奇寶貝, Magic Babies.\nThis probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists.\nHong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name!\nThat's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu\nPikachu was originally translated as 比卡超 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named 皮卡丘 (Pikaqiu). While the name 皮卡丘 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn’t sound the same at all.\nFans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pikaqiu END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is how humans are damaging #Earth!\n\nArticle: Scientists have formulated a mathematical equation to project the mammoth effect homo sapiens are having on the planet and causing irreversible damage to the environment.\nWe’re now living in the Anthropocene Era - where human activity is the primary driver of change to the environment. The impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet.\nAn equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet. Owen Gaffney and Will Stephen of Australian National University drew up the equation, which was published in The Anthropocene Review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of Earth’s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet.\nOwen Gaffney wrote in the New Scientist, \"For four billion years, the rate of change of the Earth system (E) has been a complex function of astronomical (A) and geophysical (G) forces plus internal dynamics (I): Earth’s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun’s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others.\"\nHe added, \"In the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. All these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact.\"\nSteffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century. However, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years \"have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate\".\nAccording to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces.\n\"We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,\" Steffen said.\n\"Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes.\n\"What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries.\n\"The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.\"\nPlanet Earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment’s most natural state of flux.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Are Cats So Insanely Afraid Of Cucumbers?\n\nArticle: Cats are deeply curious creatures. Recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers.\nIn the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.\nBut the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?\nTo be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: \"I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.\"\nCats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. It’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping.\n\"Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,\" Mugford continued. \"I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.\"\nWell, there’s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science.

Of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the American Beverage Association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies.\nDue to the recency of those findings (they circulated in June 2014), the results haven’t been totally disproven. However, a study conducted at the University of Nottingham published earlier this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition offers some contradiction.\nThese results won’t be surprising to much of the population, especially as the positive effects of diet beverages is called more and more frequently into question against full-sugar drinks, never mind sugar- and calorie-free water. However, there is a set of the population (one that the American Beverage Association is trying to no doubt grow) that believes diet sodas are at least as effective, if not more so, than water in losing weight.\nA sample of 89 women who usually drank diet beverages, with BMIs of 27-40 (slightly to moderately overweight), were parsed into two groups: those who would continue to drink diet beverages after eating their lunch and those who would replace their diet drinks with water.

That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances.\n\"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\"\nThe reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins.\nThis is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way.\nThat, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It's riveting filmmaking.\n\"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Captain Phillips\" END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 850 DNA matches after city clears rape kit backlog\n\nArticle: JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press\nHOUSTON (AP) — Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles, marking a major step in the city's $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced Monday.\nCharges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits — some of which dated back nearly three decades. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said.\n\"This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,\" Parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results.\nPolice are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case.\nRape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS.\nHarris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested.\n\"Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,\" she said.\nExperts say Houston's backlog — and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities.\nMore than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.\n\"This is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years,\" Parker said.\n___\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Houston END"}

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn’t our worst fight? What if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization.

Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!\"As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, \"She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten – how many people have shared that they wish they had an 'Aunt Alison' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius. She didn't realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn’t opened it yet.\"Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us – inadvertently – and now she’s even more surprised at the response our story has received.\"And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, \"For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on.

Vogue was hit with backlash in 2009 over an Adele shoot that showed her sprawled nearly facedown on a bed, her shape obscured; Vogue UK was faced with similar criticism over its Adele cover in 2011, which zoomed in on the singer's face so closely it cropped out her neck.\nIn fact, Elle faced similar accusations in 2010 with another series of covers.

Carly Melin (D-Hibbing) last spring.\nThere's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. A similar effort was approved by the Minnesota House and Senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-Governor Tim Pawlenty (R).\nThis time around, Governor Mark Dayton (D) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of Minnesota law enforcement agencies. So far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. Their opposition, according to a report in local paper St. Cloud Times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions.\nThe head of one police agency put it another way: He openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars. Minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the White House every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, Politics In Minnesota reported earlier this month.\nAs a result, Melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form. While such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure.\n\"Obviously any compromise ... [is] disheartening for patients,\" Melin told the La Crosse Tribune. \"But we’re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there’s going to have to be compromise.\"\nMinnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms. A St. Cloud State University poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue.\nHF 1818 has been referred to the Health and Human Services Policy Committee and is scheduled to have a hearing Wednesday evening.

The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it.\n(Smash bros)\nSuper Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer\nWe began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable.\nDuring our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then.\n(Smash Bros)\nFor Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free.\n(Smash Bros)\nSSB4: Local Multiplayer\nPlaying Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4.\nWe played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session.\n5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds.\nIn a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer \"testing\" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag.\n(Smash Bros)\nSSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos\nHaving this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying.\nSo guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lW2PQnS — Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014\nIf anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. — It was me, Milu! (@miluette) October 6, 2014\n\"Connectivity can depend heavily on location so I really don’t know what to say. At the very least, we’ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you’re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it’s due to the connection speed. If you play when it’s laggy, then the person you’re playing with will experience the same lag, so it’s best to play when the connection is clear.\nDuring development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It’s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.\"\n(Wordpress)\nThe Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware\nSomething tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick.\nNintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point).\nThough all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience. Having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the Wii U -- in HD and with GameCube controllers in hand. If Nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of Super Smash Bros 4, fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company.\nAre you experiencing lag in your online battles in Smash Bros 4? Let us know your experiences below!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag.\ngets better if you plug in the charger while playing END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: State senators want to make it easier to legislate behind closed doors\n\nArticle: WASHINGTON -- Arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the state's requirements for open meetings make it too difficult for them to do their jobs.\nThe plan, proposed by state Sen. Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action.\nState Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said.\n\"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues.\"\nBegay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss \"unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors.\"\n\"We're all held to a certain standard and I think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that,\" he said.\nIn fact, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. Because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. That process, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws.\n\"Staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable,\" Allen told the Daily Sun.\nDan Barr, a First Amendment lawyer with the firm Perkins Coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input.\n\"It allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"It allows people then to participate in that.\"\nBarr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult.\n\"Efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"Our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Arizona END"}

Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\"\nSo by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy.\nThe Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family’s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.\nGroening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn’t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well.\nIn 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here’s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:\nOK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn’t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield.\" And they do. You’ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that’s right.\"\nThis article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\"\nJean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it’s really an every town. It’s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of ‘The Simpsons’ were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\"\nFurther trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town’s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.\n\"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you’re a true ‘Simpsons’ fan.\"\nFor what it’s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky.\nIn a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the ‘real’ Springfield from ‘The Simpsons.’\"\nOf course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show’s city] is it’s universal. I grew up in Michigan, and I can totally relate to it. Anybody, wherever you’re from, has a Springfield near them.\"\nThe people of Oregon are just especially close.\nHere’s a walkthrough of Universal Studios’ recreation of Springfield:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Springfield, Oregon END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How long does sex normally last?\n\nArticle: If you’re a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex \"normally\" last?\nA scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: What is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time?\nI know there’s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we’ll just focus on the time to ejaculation.\nMeasuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it’s socially desirable to say you go long into the night.\nThe other problem is that people don’t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn’t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making.\nWhat does the research say?\nThe best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch.\nThat is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed \"start\" at penile penetration and \"stop\" at ejaculation. You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. But – science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we’ve got.\nSo what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation.

Exhibit a: a ‘game’ which lets users squeeze a virtual woman’s breasts who responds by squealing in disgust and covering up her chest. That’s right, the guy who made this didn’t even want to fabricate a positive sexual experience – instead he went for virtual abuse. The set-up works like this. The user dons an Oculus Rift to enter the virtual world populated by an anime character, he can then squeeze a novelty mouse pad with foam breasts with pressure sensors inside them. This hooked up to the virtual character who reacts accordingly\n6/6 Have sex with your iPad thanks to the new sex toy no-one asked for Many of us have become inseparable from our smartphones and tablets, but if you're looking to take the relationship to the next step and actually 'f*ck your iPad', sex toy brand Fleshlight has now made this possible for some reason. The company launched Fleshlight Launchpad, which allows users of their flashlight-shaped, vagina-like toy to plug it into the back of an iPad in order to 'fully immerse themselves' in whatever they're watching. The gadget \"enables the user to enjoy the full Fleshlight experience while enjoying content or communicating live with a friend via applications like Facetime or Skype,\" makers Interactive Life Forms claim, with its trailer showing a man making use of one while video-chatting with his girlfriend\nSo it’s clear there’s no one \"normal\" amount of time to have sex. The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.\nThere were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn’t seem to affect the time, and neither did men’s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.\nIt didn’t much matter which country the couples came from either – unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).\nWhy do we have sex for so long?\nAs an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?\nBefore you say, Because it’s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn’t care about fun per se – it generally only \"designs\" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. For example, even though we like eating food, we don’t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. That would be inefficient, and so we’ve evolved to find it gross.\n  Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00  Fullscreen Playback Rate 1  Subtitles subtitles off  Captions captions settings\ncaptions settings captions off  Chapters Chapters  Mute 00:00  Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done  Close Share Video: Share via:  Facebook\n Google+\n Twitter\n�\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " from 33 seconds to 44 minutes END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GOD\n\nArticle: In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her.\nThe antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked\nOne, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. The alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction.\nThe instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument.\nNowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally.\nThis led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible.\nThe GOD problem\nin several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences\nThe difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody\nMilstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013.\nIn an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. Applications that could save millions of lives.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot\n\nArticle: I was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex. The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let’s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, \"Having your prostate milked is awesome.\"\nI nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: \"It’s the male g-spot.\" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: \"Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.\"\nWell, then. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners’ self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.\nThen, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher’s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It’s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before — just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I’ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women’s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.\nBut I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn’t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.\nWithout solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don’t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop’s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.\nPart of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It’s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I’ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I’ve actually heard use the irritating I’m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt — no homo\") — before I wallop them over the head. They haven’t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they’ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person’s sexual orientation.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " anal sex END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Things in the Olsen twins' lives that make no sense\n\nArticle: It kind of goes without saying that any hope for a normal life gets dashed for people who become millionaires before they can even walk, but Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who famously portrayed Michelle Tanner on the smash sitcom Full House, cranked the dial on their wacky personal lives all the way up to 11.\nWith everything from their strange dating preferences, to some questionable business practices, to Mary-Kate's still-unexplained connection to the death of Heath Ledger, the Olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the TGIF lineup. Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business — the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become.\nBanking on bad movies\nYeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled?\nThe twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies — 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes – and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star Eugene Levy — yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. It's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. However, their 1995 collaboration with Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley, It Takes Two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nIn spite of all the critical panning, Elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. Call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch.\nThe Mary-Kate - Heath Ledger connection\nIt seems to have been forgotten over the years that Mary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death in 2008. While there was never any suggestion of foul play, Mary-Kate's name was involved from the moment the Dark Knight star's body was discovered. When Ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his New York City home, the first person she called was Mary-Kate, twice, instead of 911.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, Mary-Kate \"sent over her security team who arrived at [Ledger's] flat at the same time as the ambulance.\" Stranger still, multiple news sources reported that Mary-Kate refused to talk to federal investigators about Ledger's death unless she was granted immunity. Why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? Did it have anything to do with Ledger's accidental overdose on prescription pills?\nHer attorney, Michael C. Miller, denied she had anything to hide. \"Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,\" Miller said in a statement.\nMary-Kate's stonewall tactic eventually worked when the DEA and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into Ledger's death in August of 2008. \"The U.S. Attorney of the Southern District decided not to serve Olsen with a subpoena,\" a source told the New York Daily News, which effectively let Olsen off the hook for any further speculation.\nOpioid crisis? What opioid crisis?\nThe Olsens are now successful fashion designers. With multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. And while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at Walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label The Row in 2012.\nThat's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. According to Entertainment Weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist Damien Hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called Pill Cabinets. So you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at.\nAt any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering Mary-Kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention Ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. The good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life.\nMary-Kate looks...different\nFor most of their adult lives, the Olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of Cameron Diaz, but around November 2014, people began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. Naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming Ashley had altered her appearance, too.\nIn 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the Olsens showed up to the MET Gala (above), where Mary-Kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. It should be said, however, that the tabloid Life & Style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work Mary-Kate had done. His conclusion? Smoking and/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. Mystery solved.\nThe ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply.\nOlsens to Paltrow: 'Hold our beer'\nThe Olsen twins were asked by Elle to recommend some Christmas gift ideas in 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique Los Angeles shop, The Row. The real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as \"price upon request,\" whatever that means. (Expensive. It means very expensive.)\nExactly how much do the Olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare Van Cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? We'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1.\nAre the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the Olsen twins just trying to give Gwyneth Paltrow and her Annual GOOP Gift Guide — with its similarly market-priced personal submarine — a run for its money?\nFuller House remains one pair shy\nPortraying Michelle Tanner on Full House was undeniably the starting point for all of the Olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, Fuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline. While it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the Olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury.\nThe reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. According to show producer Bob Boyett, \"Ashley said, 'I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don't feel comfortable acting,'\" and \"Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn't want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.\"\nAmazingly, Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin doesn't consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell Us Weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he's done asking. \"But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show,\" Franklin said, adding, \"So that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open.\"\nElizabeth Olsen is no long lost twin\nActress Elizabeth Olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress — 21 years to be exact. But taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between Elizabeth and the twins.\nWhere Mary-Kate and Ashley are reclusive and cagey, Elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. Baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. Elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare. She went straight to critically-acclaimed indies, such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), then on to mega-hits such as Godzilla (2014), The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Captain America: Civil War (2016).\nElizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews, and she displays a remarkable savvy about how\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies\nMary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death\nsuccessful fashion designers\npeople began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister\nFuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline\nElizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 13 Pokémon The Designers Just Gave Up On\n\nArticle: With 721 to catch, Pokémon fans are bound to come across one or two that are just a bit, well, shit. We’ve all got that one that we just hate, purely because it looks like something they let the work experience kid draw on a Friday evening when nobody else could be bothered. I can guarantee you it didn’t take a whole day to design a ditto, did it?\nSo, we’ve trawled through all six generations of Pokemon to find the ones that are just bad designs. Who ever came up with some of these needs to share what they’re smoking!\nKlefki\nSo we’ll start with the Pokemon that inspired me to write this article because it’s a bloody key ring! For Klefki it might be quite convenient, you’d never lose your keys because they are part of your body. But it does absolutely nothing for me in the design department. There are a couple more Pokemon like this, where it seems as though the design team have sat in the office playing \"Eye Spy\" until they find an object they could attach a personality to it. And of all things, they chose a bunch of keys? Each to their own.\nRotom\nI’m trying to get my head around this one because it’s just such a strange concept. The description of Rotom on Bulbapedia (yes, Pokemon Wiki) goes as follows:\nSo it just turns into white goods whenever it feels like it purely for the purpose of changing it’s power type. It just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and TV series without anybody going \"Hang on, has anyone else realised this Pokemon is pointless?\"\nBut it keeps happening.\nLuvdisk\nThis Pokemon that I could get on board with, if it hadn’t been drawn by what appears to be an under-imaginative child. The concept is pretty nice\nit’s a Water-type Pokemon with a fish-like appearance, shaped like a heart. So much more could have been done with that brief than what we’ve got! There’s no fins or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water, and the super-necessary circle below the eye is almost laughable. The lost potential of this Pokemon has landed it on my list.\nUnknown (Unown)\nThe flying alphabet which seemingly has little functions apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy, but there’s 28 of them regardless\nincluding a question and exclamation mark. Again, this feels like a feeble attempt to introduce a new Pokemon with not much thought put into it. I’m just waiting for the generation where they’ll add a mysterious set of number Pokemon, which is seeming increasingly likely.\nVanilluxe\nAnother one of my favourites because it’s just so awful. Yes, as you can see above, it’s an ice-cream cone! The designers thought this Ice Pokemon was such a good idea in fact, that Vanilleuxe is the third evolution (after Vanillite and Vanillish) to be featured in the game. I find this one lazy because they’ve added a scoop of ice-cream to resemble the evolution (similar to Dugtrio, Dodrio, etc.)\nand because it was a terrible ide, to begin with, and they’ve managed to scrape three new Pokemon out of it.\nJynx\nWhat even was this supposed to be in the first place? A terrifying large-bosomed-womanhood made for mankind. Jynx makes my list for being just plain creepy.\nCofagrigus\nAnother one of those that’s just a bit, why? It’s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arms and a face on its forehead. All in all, it just looks a bit silly. In its description on Bulbapedia, it says the Pokemon lives in ruins and can swallow up nearby people. Well, now I’m scared.\nVoltorb\nThe award for the laziest Pokemon design ever has to go to Voltorb. This electric Pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game – it’s just a Pokeball with eyes!\nDedenne\nDedenne earned its place because it’s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the much-loved logo and everyone’s favourite, Pikachu. Everything down to the bright cheeks and zig-zagged tail screams cheap imitation – and nobody can replace our Pika!\nDruddigon\nAward for the most poorly drawn dragon Pokemon goes to Druddigon. The colours are pretty nasty, and I reckon those blue leaves that are supposed to be wings wouldn’t hold the rest of the weight. I kind of feel sorry for him, being so awkward and all. Looking like Charizard’s unloved cousin can’t be all that much fun.\nExeggutor\nIt’s quite hard to understand what Exeggutor is all about, considering its predecessor is a row of eggs with a name that connotes to eggs, and then it evolves into some coconut tree. What, how does that happen? I’ve never heard of coconuts hatching from eggs but in the Pokemon world, anything seems possible.\nGarbodor\nIt’s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list, as you can imagine but I think I’ve found it in, Garbador. It’s a literal pile of rubbish from an overflowing black bag. Yeah, you read it right the first time. Its pre-evolution is just a bin bag, not quite yet full enough to split. How do they get away with this? \nSunabaa (Japanese version name) \nThis Pokemon hasn’t been released yet, but it’s coming up on the Sun and Moon games this year. It’s a haunted sandcastle, but that’s about as much as we know.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Klefki\nRotom\nLuvdisk\nUnknown (Unown)\nVanilluxe END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: 9 things Elizabeth Taylor taught us about the art of love\n\nArticle: Sure, she was married eight times, but there’s no denying that Elizabeth Taylor was a woman who knew how to live and love.\nWith her joie de vivre and insatiable appetite for the opposite sex, Taylor had the kind of love life most of us can only dream about. She lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011.\nIn honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from Liz, the fiercest old Hollywood dame of all. \n\"I don’t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. I am not and couldn’t be,\" the mom of four once remarked. And it was true — the actress was anything but ordinary. While her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for Life and Look magazines, La Liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was NBD at a time when divorce wasn’t nearly as accepted as it is now. She was seriously a woman before her time.\nTaylor’s fifth (and sixth!) husband Richard Burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries:\n\"She is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography,\" he wrote. \"She can be arrogant and willful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!\"\nYeah, we think we could get used to someone fawning over us like that.\nYou would think things would have been awkward between Elizabeth Taylor and the late Debbie Reynolds after Eddie Fisher left Reynolds for Taylor (the couple’s longtime friend) in 1959. Instead, the two women remained pals until Taylor’s death in March 2011.\n\"Women liked her and men adored her — my husband included — and her love for her children is enduring,\" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly after Taylor’s passing. \"People always assume you’re going to carry a grudge, but I don’t do that. We passed through that with time.\"\nTaylor reportedly accepted a pave diamond-heart necklace after one of her legendary screaming matches with Burton. It would have been rude not to accept, right?\n\"I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up,\" Dame Elizabeth once remarked. \"It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.\" We know the type. Still, if Taylor taught us anything about love, it’s that there are plenty of fish in the sea, so if the person you’re with doesn’t think you’re young or pretty enough, tell them to get lost.\nDisagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship. Taylor and Burton were so prepared for them, they would reportedly rent three suites when they checked into hotels ― one above and another below their own. That way, the couple figured, their neighbors would be spared if one of their infamous lovers’ quarrels broke out.\n\"I’ve always admitted that I’m ruled by my passions,\" Taylor said. No kidding. When it came to love, Liz was insatiable — so much so that the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\" when she took up with Burton, her married co-star in the 1966 film \"Cleopatra.\" After that, the couple lived out a totally epic whirlwind romance: marrying in 1964, making up after epic fights time and time again, and eventually divorcing in 1974... only to remarry in a private African ceremony sixteen months later.\n\"Maybe we loved each other too much,\" Elizabeth said, as if such a thing were possible.\nBut what if a relationship doesn’t work out? We’ve always been partial to Taylor’s advice on getting over someone: \"Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.\" 🙌\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I don’t pretend to be an ordinary housewife\nPeople always assume you’re going to carry a grudge, but I don’t do that\nthere are plenty of fish in the sea\nDisagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship\nI’ve always admitted that I’m ruled by my passions END"}

His convention-speech comment, \"I alone can fix it,\" should make every American shudder. He is, we believe, a danger to the Republic.’ Special: No Need For Viagra If You Do This (Once Daily)\nThe Chronicle is very clear about how it came to its decision, despite The Chronicle is very clear about how it came to its decision, despite endorsing Mitt Romney in the last election. Normally, they wouldn’t endorse any candidate this early in the race, but they explained their reason for doing so as follows:\n‘The Chronicle editorial page does not typically endorse early in an election cycle; we prefer waiting for the campaign to play out and for issues to emerge and be addressed. We make an exception in the 2016 presidential race, because the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is not merely political. It is something much more basic than party preference.’ ‘An election between the Democrat Clinton and, let’s say, the Republican Jeb Bush or John Kasich or Marco Rubio, even the hyper-ideological Ted Cruz, would spark a much-needed debate about the role of government and the nation’s future, about each candidate’s experience and abilities. To choose the candidate who defeated them — fairly and decisively, we should point out — is to repudiate the most basic notions of competence and capability.’\nThe Houston Chronicle clearly recognizes the fact that the Republican presidential nominee has sent the Republican party into turmoil. Many Republicans have purposely distanced themselves from Donald Trump, and there will undoubtedly be more Republicans giving a wide berth to the GOP candidate before the November election is upon us. Being that Texas is considered a \"red\" state, it is safe to assume that this election is about a lot more than respective parties.\nMichelle Obama rationalized this line of thought best in her Michelle Obama rationalized this line of thought best in her DNC speech\n‘Because when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military at your command, you can’t make snap decisions. You can’t have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out.

Clinton is praised for her experience and knowledge when it comes to issues like healthcare, energy, immigration, and foreign policy.\n‘On the issues, there’s no comparison in terms of thoughtfulness, thoroughness and practicality. Acknowledging the influence of erstwhile competitor Bernie Sanders for example, she will focus as president on repairing an economy that has left many working people behind and struggling.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here's a controversial idea about China's economy that no one wants to hear\n\nArticle: Reuters\nFor years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project.\nThat means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector.\nThat is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers.\nBut what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\"\nFrom the note (emphasis added):\n\"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies.\n\"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries.\n\"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\"\nWork, work, work, work, work\nWhat really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter.\nHSBC\nArguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt.\nChina has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam.\nThat, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors.\nSo, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of.\nThe rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry.\nDuring the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output.\nSo what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down.\nThe problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term.\nFrom the note (emphasis added):\n\"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\"\nHSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term.\nMeanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.\nPretty controversial ideas, no?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " China is too quick to rebalance its services sector END"}

An hour later, the dog was dead. The woman was shocked by what killed him.\nThe three-year-old Border Collie chewed on some plants as the family took a walk through the Horsetooth Reservoir. Shortly after the walk, the dog didn't look well. He was taken to the vet.\nAccording to the vet, the plant the dog was chewing on was deadly water hemlock.

A few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours.\nA dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. This will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. If a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage.

Clear skin or acne you are the same person. I get asked how can I be confident when my skin looks like this? The reason I decided to accept myself for how I looked is because for years I suffered with acne and for years I let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because I was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. Because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. I knew I couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point I would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. I thought about the days when I used to have no worries when I was younger and here's what I came up with- I wasn't living life trying to impress anyone I wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful I didn't spend my time trying to make myself look perfect I didn't sit at home comparing myself to others on Instagram It's the world we live in today that makes us think like this. I don't want young girls feeling the same way I did. I don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful.
