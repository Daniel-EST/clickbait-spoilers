{"prompt": "Clickbait: Five Nights at Freddy’s Sequel Delayed for Weird Reason\n\nArticle: Five Nights at Freddy’s creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series.\nFor the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series after another, with four core games, one RPG spinoff, and a novel released so far. The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months.\nAccording to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\"\nDelays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game.\nCawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn’t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.\nFans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon’s post to the contrary.\nWith October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location‘s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.\nFive Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.\nSource: Scott Cawthon\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How 1 model prepares for lingerie shoots\n\nArticle: The life of a lingerie model is quite a foreign one to us. But participating in brutal castings, undergoing intense preparation and posing in ultra-sexy skivvies have all become routine for Elettra Wiedemann.\nThe model (and daughter of Isabelli Rossellini) is the new face of Agent Provocateur, and she shows off the brand's signature seductive lingerie in the latest commercial alongside actress Melissa George. So how does one step into such a daunting role? First, you have to mentally prepare.\n\"I don't normally think of myself as sexy, but when I put the AP lingerie on I felt very sexy -- in control, seductive and powerful,\" Wiedemann told Harper's Bazaar UK. \"It’s kind of like a superhero suit, albeit quite a skimpy one!\"\nSurely, the famous foodie -- Wiedemann hosts an online cooking series for Vogue called \"Elettra's Goodness\" -- had to change her lifestyle a little as well. She explains:\n\"To prepare I did extra strength work, so weights, and quite a few planks for my core. My diet stayed pretty much the same, except I cut out sugar for the week of the shoot.\"\nThat doesn't sound too bad, especially when you consider the egg powder diet some of her lingerie modeling peers take on before a gig. Thankfully, gals like Wiedemann and Victoria's Secret model Lindsay Ellingson, who actually adds fat to her diet to be \"sexier and curvier\" for the retailer's annual fashion show, are setting a good precedent for those who want to get in shape in a healthy way.\nAs for us, we don't plan on participating in a lingerie shoot -- or cutting out sugar -- any time soon.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How This 20-Year-Old Died From Kissing Her Boyfriend\n\nArticle: CTV News\nMyriam Ducre-Lemay, 20, died in 2012 after kissing her boyfriend — he'd eaten a peanut butter sandwich and wasn't aware of her peanut allergy (or the severity of it) and she was not carrying her EpiPen with her at the time, CTV News reports. Her mother is just now publicizing the story to help others avoid the same situation.\nAccording to CJAD, Ducre-Lemay and her boyfriend had been out at a party earlier that night, which is why she didn't have her medication or her Medic Alert bracelet on her. After the kiss, she had trouble breathing, tried using her asthma pump, and, when that didn't work, asked her boyfriend about peanuts — when he said he'd eaten them, she told him to call 911.\nHe attempted to give her CPR before the ambulance arrived. Emergency crews attempted to resuscitate her with epinephrine, but failed. En route to the hospital, Ducre-Lemay suffered cardiopulmonary arrest, which led to cerebral anoxia (oxygen deprivation to the brain). She was taken off the respirator and died.\nHead of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Montreal Children's Hospital Dr. Christine McCusker told CTV people between the ages 15 to 30 are in the \"risk age range\" and are most likely to suffer from severe allergic reactions. This is why people with allergies carry \"EpiPen[s], even though you don't want to and even though it's not cool,\" McCuskey said. \"People don't necessarily recognize it can go from that point where, 'I feel funny' to 'Uh oh' very fast.\"\nAccording to FOX News, Ducre-Lemay had recently told people her allergies had decreased in severity, but McCusker said that is only true of every 1 in 5 allergy patients. Though many outlets report brushing your teeth helps eliminate the chance of an allergic reaction in this situation, the only thing that will ensure it won't happen is waiting a long time after you consume peanuts to kiss.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " he'd eaten a peanut butter sandwich and wasn't aware of her peanut allergy END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How distance brought an end to an NBA power couple that withstood conflicts of interest and professional trials:\n\nArticle: Phil Jackson wasn't in the mood to stop and catch up. His New York Knicks had gotten out of Staples Center with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic Lakers fans on the big screen.\n\"I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,\" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks' locker room on Dec. 11.\nThere was such a distance in the way he said, \"The Lakers.\" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason.\nHis connection with Los Angeles, and his fiancée, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement.\nThe announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot.\nLike the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance.\nThe owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA coach of all time.\nThen there were hurdles, such as Jeanie Buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother Jim Buss being in charge of basketball operations.\nSo many tangled webs, and yet Jeanie Buss and Jackson somehow made it work for 17 years.\nDuring the best of times, when the Lakers were winning NBA championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in Marina Del Rey. At games, Jeanie would sit with her girlfriends Linda Rambis and Stacy Kennedy in the second row, across the court from the Lakers bench, where Phil could see her and the players could hear her.\nOnce on the drive in, Jackson mentioned Lamar Odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. So during the game, Buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for Odom as he checked into the game. \"Take your pants off!\" they yelled out, as Odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers' table. He beamed at the attention.\nIt was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. The way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. That was Camelot.\nOnce Jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court.\nBut when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand.\nAs always, he would do it for Jeanie.\nThis time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead.\nJackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture.\nIt did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.\nThe engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry.\nSo now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. If they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships.\nAs the years went by, Jackson focused in on the Knicks and Buss focused on the Lakers. He would come to Los Angeles when he could, and she would see him in New York when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect.\nBoth of their legacies are tied to what they do next. Buss must decide whether to reboot the Lakers' front office. Jackson needs to make the Knicks into a contender. Those close to Jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the Knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer.\nThere had been speculation that Jackson could return to the Lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from New York. Those are the types of implausible things that happen in Camelot.\nIt was never meant to be.\nBuss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. She also has maintained close ties with first-year coach Luke Walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous Lakers coaches. Those close to Buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office.\nAll of those are massive things, that Jackson and Buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles.\nSo the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end Tuesday night. Camelot was over.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Lawmakers could do this to fight corruption. But they won’t.\n\nArticle: In February, when Rep. David Jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of Congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the Florida Republican had only six co-sponsors.\nThen, three weeks ago, \"60 Minutes\" did a sympathetic piece on Jolly’s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars.\nAnd now? The number of co-sponsors on Jolly’s bill has jumped from six all the way up to — um, eight. No senator has come forward with similar legislation.\nJolly, appearing Monday morning at the National Press Club with his lead Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Nolan (Minn.), was not surprised. \"We’ve got six more co-sponsors than I thought we might have,\" he said. It’s \"a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the Congress are. . . . A member’s political survival depends on raising money — that’s the reality.\"\nJolly speaks the truth. Lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system — but nothing happens.\nDemocrats talk about overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. But that ultimate fix isn’t happening soon. In the House, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections — another good idea — but so far he has only one Republican, gadfly Walter Jones (N.C.). Republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once championed.\nThis is why Jolly’s idea deserves a look. He calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. The goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. \"We’re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money,\" he said. \"In the face of growing crises around the globe, you’ve got a part-time Congress.\" This, he said, \"is a first-rate scandal.\"\nI’ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working — returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. Jolly, now a Senate candidate in Florida, offers another tack.\nThe Republican Party is predictably opposed. The National Republican Congressional Committee, in a letter to CBS after the \"60 Minutes\" segment, accused Jolly of peddling \"fiction\" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day.\nUnfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the Orlando Sentinel calling Jolly’s bill a \"cynical example of fraudulent reform\" because \"all that would change is that congressmen wouldn’t have to do the dirty work.\"\nBut while Jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his Senate run. And though the bill wouldn’t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways.\nJolly’s Democratic sidekick, Nolan, said that when he first served in Congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground.\n\"If you’ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there’s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we’re seeing the results of that,\" he said. \"We’re looking at the last couple of sessions of the Congress of the United States as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. Why? Well, if everybody’s busy campaigning and raising money, there’s no time for governing.\"\nThe little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop \"soliciting or accepting\" financial contributions.\nBut Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W. Bill Young, continues to agitate. He said he’s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the NRCC, and he said \"I don’t buy the notion\" that he needs more sponsors before House leadership grants a hearing on his bill.\nJolly is a potential ally of Democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that Citizens United \"could be revisited\" and that \"we can do better.\" Until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. \"You think you get elected to represent 700,000 people,\" he said. \"But you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you’ve got to go raise $2 million — and that makes members angry.\"\nOr at least it should.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In February, when Rep.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How big is Justin Bieber's dick really?\n\nArticle: A single question now plagues the minds of all Americans, weighing down our brains as we slump in our office chairs, then slump in our cars, then slump in our couches, and then slump into bed: how big is Justin Bieber's penis really?\nThe swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minders would have us believe that Justin Bieber has a huge dick.\nLast week, Calvin Klein released photos of Bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign. One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side:\nBieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint.\nBieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him.\nThe question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake?\nOr did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?\n(It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?)\nBut in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing?\nLet's be true detectives.\nThis is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python.\nLast September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one.\nThere are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is.\nFor that, we must consult more candid shots.\nIn 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here:\nThis is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have.\nNext we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber's Bulge, a blog \"dedicated to Justin Bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge,\" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo.\nHere is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe.\nThat is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong.\nNeves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D:\nSpeaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: \"Take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed.\"\nNilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment:\nAnd to make up it, here's a new quote from Justin's trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\"\nIndeed you do.\nTwo people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average—large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement.\nIn this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man.\nStill, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber? Have you ever seen his dick? Do you know someone who has? Are you Scooter Braun? Let's settle this debate once and for all.

After being out of the league for six years, Traylor died of a heart attack in 2011 while playing in Puerto Rico.\nThe rest of the top 10 -- No. 2 Mike Bibby, No. 3 Raef LaFrentz, No. 4 Antawn Jamison, No. 7 Jason Williams and No. 8 Larry Hughes -- all enjoyed some success but combined for a grand total of two All-Star appearances between them. The active trio has long stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class.\nCarter, the No. 5 pick -- who was traded for Jamison, his friend and North Carolina teammate, on draft night -- soared to eight All-Star appearances with the Toronto Raptors and New Jersey Nets. Once known as \"Half Man, Half Amazing,\" Carter redefined his game as he aged, becoming a sage role player in recent years, now helping the Memphis Grizzlies fight for playoff positioning in the Western Conference.\nNowitzki, the No. 9 pick despite not being sure of his desire to play in the NBA at the time, forced folks to change the way they think about 7-footers while he climbed to sixth on the league's all-time scoring list. He remains the face of the franchise in Dallas, the only NBA city he'll ever call home.\nA sore right Achilles tendon robbed Nowitzki of most of the first two months of this season, and most likely a chance to play in the postseason for the 16th time in 17 years, although the big German refuses to give up hope.\nPierce, the No. 10 pick, will one day see his No. 34 raised to the rafters in Boston alongside the other Celtics greats, presumably pretty soon. \"The Truth\" has played for three teams in four seasons since leaving Boston, reuniting with coach Doc Rivers for his final stop with the Clippers, for whom Pierce is a part-time player but full-time locker room presence.\nNowitzki (29,757), Pierce (26,361) and Carter (24,295) have combined for 80,413 career points and have an outside shot to be the highest-scoring draft trio in NBA history. They rank behind only the Class of '84 (Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley with 82,995 points) and Class of '96 (Kobe Bryant, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson with 82,516).\nThe '98 greats separately sat down with ESPN recently for a three-way Q&A.\nNowitzki: I didn't go to the draft. I actually worked out with Holger [Geschwindner, Nowitzki's shooting coach] those couple of days, and I stayed at Holger's house. We couldn't watch it anywhere. It wasn't on TV back in Germany. I remember in the middle of the night, we got a call and it was [then-Mavericks coach] Don Nelson. He was like, 'Hey, we just drafted you guys. We'd love to come over and see you guys,' because I had said that I wasn't sure if I was coming [to the NBA] or not.\nI was like, 'This is crazy!' After the whole Hoop Summit, I guess there was a little hype, but I never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high, especially after saying that I wasn't sure if I would come or not, worried about basically going from the second division to the NBA. That was a huge jump, and I was a little worried. It was bizarre. 'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible.\nThen [Mavericks GM Donnie Nelson] and Nellie came maybe a couple of days later. They showed up in Wurzburg. [Then-Mavericks owner] Ross Perot came in the private plane. I had this press conference in this small little hotel that I'll never forget. It was unbelievable. I remember like maybe two or three media people showed up, because it was on such short notice, right? Ross was the one who wanted the press conference, but we couldn't even get a TV station there. There was literally like three people there. It was so bizarre, so bizarre.\n\"'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible.\"\nDirk Nowitzki, on his reaction to being drafted by the Mavs in 1998\nThen Ross flew out again, and Donnie and Nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over. They said, 'Hey, don't make a decision before we fly you to Dallas. We want you to see everything and meet some of the guys.' So I agreed to that. I flew back with Donnie and Holger, stayed at Nellie's house back in the day. Had a press conference. Never had a suit, so I remember right from the airport, we went right to Lombardo's [Custom Apparel in Dallas]. I had the worst jacket on, and we had a press conference.\nThat's when I met Nashie [Steve Nash] for the first time, because they flew him in for the press conference. It kind of clicked from there. I think on my second night, Nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me, and Fin [Michael Finley] came and Strick [Erick Strickland] came. Nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town. I just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as I could with my English.\nThen the next night was our decision. They set a press conference the morning before I left, and Nellie was like, 'Think about it all night, but we need a decision before you leave.' So that night was rough. I remember I was sitting with Holger around the pool for hours. Obviously, I had concerns. I had concerns about making that huge jump. I'd never lived anywhere but with my parents. I guess the end of the story was, 'We'll try.' They had a young team. It wasn't like they were a great team right [then], not really a playoff team, so you could get some minutes and develop.\nNellie said, 'At the end of the day, if things don't work out, you could always go back to Europe.' That's always an option after two or three years [when] your contract is over. If they don't take the option after three years, you're back home in Europe. So the next day, I went to the press conference and was like, 'I'll try.'\nPierce: I remember slipping and not really knowing where I was going to end up. Because I only worked out for the top five teams.\nI remember I didn't know who Jason Williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. It was just weird. I thought I'd be in the top five, and I slipped all the way to 10, so it was a strange night for me.\nAnd then I go to Boston, a team I really didn't like growing up, because I was a Lakers fan. But you know, things happen for a reason. I guess it was meant for me to be in Boston. It worked out OK.\nCarter: You finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams, and it's the unexpected. We knew either Bibby or Olowokandi was going one or two, and then after that, it's all hearsay. I heard anywhere from three to eight. That's what I hear, so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call: 'OK, we're going to get you if you're available.'\nI just remember sitting around. Olowokandi, OK. Bibby, OK. Raef LaFrentz, great. From there, you really didn't know. I remember sitting at the table next to me was Antawn Jamison. Our families were sitting next to each other, laughing and talking. I remember saying, 'Man, what do you think is going to happen?' We had no idea.\nThey called Antawn at four. I mean, he was my suitemate in college and very good friends, so [I was] over the moon. It felt like I got drafted, because I was just nervous and excited for him, as if it was me. But the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for Toronto. So it was kind of like, 'OK, well,\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Vince Carter\nPaul Pierce\nDirk Nowitzki END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Cancer is contagious among clams. What about us?\n\nArticle: \"We were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn’t know where they would be discovered,\" said Elizabeth P. Murchison, a cancer biologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new study.\nIn the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. These mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses.\nHowever they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. Either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started.\nA decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. In the 1990s Tasmanian devils in Australia began developing deadly face tumors. But DNA in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed.\nTasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single Tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. Transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other Tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. A second strain of the cancer was identified last year.\nDogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. The tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. Scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago.\nFor years, Tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer. But last year, Stephen P. Goff, a molecular biologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams.\nFrom New York to Prince Edward Island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s. Carol Reinisch, a marine biologist at Environment Canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort.\nShe suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host. For help, Dr. Reinisch turned to Dr. Goff.\nThe two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams. But they did discover that DNA in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams.\nAfter examining the DNA, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor.\n\"Somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast,\" Dr. Goff said.\nHe and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals — known collectively as bivalves — had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why. They chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams.\nIn every case, the researchers reported in the journal Nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious. \"We are now at four for four,\" Dr. Goff said.\nAs it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains. Even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species’s own cells.\nInstead, the scientists matched the cancer’s DNA to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of Spain. But Dr. Goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease.\nThey concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams. It killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind.\n\"That’s really quite incredible,\" Dr. Murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer. The new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier.\nWith eight contagious cancers now on the books, Dr. Murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought. \"They might be emerging fairly often,\" she said.\nSo should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? \"I don’t think we should be starting to panic,\" Dr. Murchison said.\nThere have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer. An estimated 0.04 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example. But in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host.\nYet it’s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power. In 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer. The mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters.\nThe new research \"does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans,\" Dr. Murchison said.\nDr. Goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers. They hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body.\nThe evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body. In shellfish, Dr. Murchison said, \"we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I don’t think we should be starting to panic END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This NFL Player Slept in a Utility Closet in College to Save Money\n\nArticle: Green Bay Packers punter Tim Masthay was obsessed with saving money before he even had any. So much so that he slept in a utility closet in college because it reduced his rent to only $100 a month.\nTim and his wife Amanda recently attended the NFL’s Personal Finance Camp, which educates players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.\n\"Personal finance acumen is important for everyone. It doesn’t matter if you’re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between. If you’re old or young or single or married. It’s important for everyone.\"\nYou would think one of the professors leading the classes at the camp said this, but Tim did, after being asked why he attended. Spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between April 4 and April 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\nMeet the NFL player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) Tim Masthay, of the Green Bay Packers, and his wife Amanda are the best team in the NFL when it comes to personal finance.\nWhen we asked the Masthays what they did with his first big NFL paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league’s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children.\nAnd when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they’re not happy with the advice or returns they’re getting, Tim said he’s never had one. He invests his money himself in low-cost index funds.\nAnd if you’re wondering how many credit cards they have. They have one.\nAlso see: What it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of NFL players\nTim, 29, met his wife Amanda while they were sophomores at the University of Kentucky. They married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way. They’re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? Here’s what they shared with us.\nWhat it’s like to make so much money while you’re in your 20s\nTim wasn’t drafted out of college but was signed — and released — by the Indianapolis Colts before the 2009 season started. He later signed with the Green Bay Packers and has had great success with them. He signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $1.2 million signing bonus. And he won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011.\nI almost fell on the floor when I saw his first paycheck. Amanda Masthay\nWhile Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. \"That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,\" Amanda said.\nThey were tempted to buy things when they got the check. \"It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn’t buy some car that we really couldn’t afford,\" she said.\nTim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. \"There was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn’t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience.\"\nThe unique financial challenges of being an NFL player — and the wife of a player\nWhen you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, Tim said. \"How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it’s very difficult to project how much you’re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.\"\nHow the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.\nHe said another challenge is that they’re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. \"We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you’ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It’s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,\" Tim said.\nBut he also acknowledged that \"if you have some vision for the future, it’s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment.\"\nHow they got so smart about money\nThe Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky — he was an economics major and she was a marketing major — were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential.\n\"If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people’s cars and save up for my spending money,\" Amanda said.\nTim said that at Kentucky’s business school he took a class in his sophomore year — in which he met Amanda, incidentally — and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you’re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it’s historically returned, you’d have $1 million when you were 60. \"I remember thinking, wow that’s interesting,\" he said.\nThat made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed.\n\"By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That’s what I bought her wedding ring with,\" he said. (He spent part of it on the ring.)\nTom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Tim Masthay punting in a game against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 14, 2014.\nOne mistake?\nTim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate. They bought a house in Kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in Green Bay. They’ve since sold the Kentucky home but say they didn’t like owning a home they only used for part of the year.\nMarriage and money\nAmanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the Personal Finance Camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season.\n\"Finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there’s something we can do that’s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn’t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?\"\nDuring the interview, Amanda and Tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other’s sentences. When we asked Tim what he thought helped him go from being waived by the Colts in 2009 to setting records with the Packers in 2011, Amanda said: \"He married me.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Tim Masthay END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The surprising thing that may be making you crave junk food\n\nArticle: The 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out. So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste...\nBy Jena Pincott\n\"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\"\nTry this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers.\n\"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\"\nOK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them.\n\"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\"\nA bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.\n\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"\nSurprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.\n\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"\nWhile the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)\n\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"\nGood news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.\n\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"\nNow consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO. (But burger lovers, be heartened: Scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " gut bacteria END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: We've finally figured out when the moon formed\n\nArticle: The cataclysmic collision between Earth and a Mars-size object that forged the moon may have occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, suggests a study of meteorites with ancient fragments from that cosmic impact.\nThis finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial Earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself.\nEarth was born about 4.5 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward. The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)]\n\"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com.\nHowever, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts.\n\"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said.\nTo find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of Earth's mass — away from Earth and the moon.\nThe simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.\n\"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\"\nCollisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.\n\"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\"\nThe researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.\n\"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\"\nThis research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology — we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\"\nIf future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said.\nThe scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 4.47 billion years ago END"}

It read, in part:\nWe’ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush’s aloofness. Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. But we don’t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It’s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.\nTough stuff, right?\nThe second thing that happened was The second thing that happened was this tweet\nObama playing golf at Martha's Vineyard with Larry David today — Manu Raju (@mkraju) — Manu Raju (@mkraju) August 18, 2016\nCue outrage.\nThe I-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to Obama. George W. Bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. ( The I-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to Obama. George W.

Work, especially in this digital age, follows you around.\nStill, it's worth noting this moment. And that's because it speaks to Obama's unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on \"how it looks\" and/or \"how it will play.\"\nObama has long been a rejectionist on this front. His stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the Affordable Care Act badly hamstrung his party's attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law. His unwillingness to say the words \"radical Islamic terror\" have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And so on and so forth.\nObama just doesn't like to fake it. If he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actually is stupid — he won't do it. Obama just doesn't like to fake it. If he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actuallyisstupid — he won't do it. This riff in response to Republican criticism of how Obama describes the threat posed by the Islamic State militant group, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL, captures his view on perception politics nicely:\nFor a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase \"radical Islam.\" That’s the key, they tell us — we can’t beat ISIL unless we call them \"radical Islamists.\" What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction... ...There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn’t use the label \"radical Islam.\" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. Not once. So if someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who we're fighting, if there's anyone out there who thinks we're confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield.\nHe's genuinely angry — not an emotion you see all that much from any politician at that level but particularly the usually calm and professorial Obama. And he's angry because in Obama's mind the sort of performance-for-the-sake-of-performance that Republicans are demanding is everything that's wrong with politics.\n(Nota bene: For all of you \"ALL HE DOES IS PERFORM\" readers, I know that is a view of Obama that many people hold. I am not blind to it. But this piece is about how Obama thinks of himself . Not how you or I think of him.

A few hours and tests later, the doctor clarifies that the unusual pain the wife is feeling on her right side isn’t the no-biggie appendicitis they suspected but rather ovarian cancer.\nAs the couple head home in the early morning of Sept. 6, somehow through the foggy shock of it all, they make the connection that today, the day they learned what had been festering, is also the day they would have officially kicked off their empty-nestering. The youngest of their three children had just left for college.\nSo many plans instantly went poof.\nNo trip with my husband and parents to South Africa. No reason, now, to apply for the Harvard Loeb Fellowship. No dream tour of Asia with my mother. No writers’ residencies at those wonderful schools in India, Vancouver, Jakarta.\nNo wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar.\nThis is when we entered what I came to think of as Plan \"Be,\" existing only in the present. As for the future, allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article, Jason Brian Rosenthal.\nHe is an easy man to fall in love with. I did it in one day.\nLet me explain: My father’s best friend since summer camp, \"Uncle\" John, had known Jason and me separately our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out east and took my first job in California. When I moved back home to Chicago, John — who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other — set us up on a blind date.\nIt was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, \"Uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.\"\nBy the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.\nJason? He knew a year later.\nI have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I’m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.\nFirst, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.\nThe following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.\nHe is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.\nIf our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food — man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening’s meal.\nJason loves listening to live music; it’s our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else.\nWhen I was working on my first memoir, I kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon. She would say, \"I’d like to see more of this character.\"\nGet lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.\nOf course, I would agree — he was indeed a captivating character. But it was funny because she could have just said: \"Jason. Let’s add more about Jason.\"\nHe is an absolutely wonderful father. Ask anyone. See that guy on the corner? Go ahead and ask him; he’ll tell you. Jason is compassionate — and he can flip a pancake.\nJason paints. I love his artwork. I would call him an artist except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown office most days from 9 to 5. Or at least it did before I got sick.\nIf you’re looking for a dreamy, let’s-go-for-it travel companion, Jason is your man. He also has an affinity for tiny things: taster spoons, little jars, a mini-sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench, which he presented to me as a reminder of how our family began.\nHere is the kind of man Jason is: He showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flowers. This is a man who, because he is always up early, surprises me every Sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot: a spoon, a mug, a banana.\nThis is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says, \"Give me your palm.\" And, voilà, a colorful gumball appears. (He knows I love all the flavors but white.)\nMy guess is you know enough about him now. So let’s swipe right.\nWait. Did I mention that he is incredibly handsome? I’m going to miss looking at that face of his.\nIf he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale, it’s not too far off, except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half decades of playing house together. And the part about me getting cancer. Blech.\nIn my most recent memoir (written entirely before my diagnosis), I invited readers to send in suggestions for matching tattoos, the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink.\nI was totally serious about this and encouraged submitters to be serious as well. Hundreds poured in. A few weeks after publication in August, I heard from a 62-year-old librarian in Milwaukee named Paulette.\nShe suggested the word \"more.\" This was based on an essay in the book where I mention that \"more\" was my first spoken word (true). And now it may very well be my last (time shall tell).\nIn September, Paulette drove down to meet me at a Chicago tattoo parlor. She got hers (her very first) on her left wrist. I got mine on the underside of my left forearm, in my daughter’s handwriting. This was my second tattoo; the first is a small, lowercase \"j\" that has been on my ankle for 25 years. You can probably guess what it stands for. Jason has one too, but with more letters: \"AKR.\"\nI want more time with Jason. I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this?\nI am wrapping this up on Valentine’s Day, and the most genuine, non-vase-oriented gift I can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds Jason, and another love story begins.\nI’ll leave this intentional empty space below as a way of giving you two the fresh start you deserve.\nWith all my love, Amy\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jason Brian Rosenthal\n END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: She Wraps A Piece Of Bread Around Her Foot. When She Takes It Off? SHOCKING!\n\nArticle: Summertime means sandals — at least, when you absolutely have to wear shoes at all! \nIt also means painting your nails cute colors, feeling the grass beneath your soles, and enjoying the cool breeze on your toes.\nBut it also means that you might become more aware of the less cute aspects of your feet...\nAfter years of wear and tear, being stuffed in shoes, and holding up your whole self, everyone’s feet develop rough patches and bumps. This is normal and natural, but it’s not always pleasant.\nWhile calluses typically only look unpleasant and feel rough to the touch, corns — which are hard, rounded types of calluses — can be painful when pressure is applied, such as when walking or wearing a shoe.\nIt can also make you self-conscious if you’re walking around barefoot or in shoes that leave your feet mostly exposed.\nAnd since there’s a lot of evidence that shows going barefoot is really good for your overall health, you’ll definitely want to show off your tootsies this summer.\nBut if you have corns, calluses, or other rough, hard skin on your feet? Never fear. There are simple, inexpensive, and all-natural ways to smooth your feet and get them soft and ready to show off, and you can do them all right at home.\nAnd of course, this isn’t just for feet, so if you have corns or calluses elsewhere, like on your hands, you can try these remedies there, too.\nRead on to learn how to make your feet summer-ready, and then break out some nail polish and wiggle your toes!\nWhat Is A Callus?\nA callus is a thick, tough area of skin that forms in response to repeated and regular friction or pressure. Your body builds up a callus to protect your skin.\nMost people have calluses on their hands and feet caused by walking, holding a pen, or other activity.\nCalluses might be unsightly, but they’re typically harmless and painless.\nWhat Are Corns?\nA corn is actually a type of callus. It’s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes.\nLike a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes.\nUnlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface.\nSo, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do?\nRemedy #1: Apple Cider Vinegar And Castor Oil\nIn a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet.\nThis will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone. For corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak.\nDo this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days.\nA word about filing down calluses: Be gentle. It will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse.\nRemedy #2: Vitamin E Or Vitamin A\nWhile they’re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out.\nRubbing the oil inside a vitamin E or vitamin A capsule is a great treatment for corns.\nRub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock.\nDo this every night until the corn disappears.\nRemedy #3: Lemon Peel\nSlice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it.\nPress it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage. Keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight.\nRepeat every night until the corn is gone.\nRemedy #4: Onion And White Vinegar\nLike the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns.\nBut be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger!\nJust like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight.\nRemedy #5: Bread And Apple Cider Vinegar\nHalf a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot.\nAttach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn’t leak, and then cover with a sock.\nThe callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning.\nRemedy #6: Castor Oil\nThis remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business. It’s also great for corns on small, hard-to-bandage places.\nTake a non-medicated corn pad and place around the corn. Dab a few drops of castor oil onto the corn, and then cover with some adhesive tape to keep everything in place.\nIf you’re wearing socks, wear old ones in case the oil leaks.\nRemedy #7: Aspirin\nCrush about five uncoated aspirin tablets into powder, and mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to form a paste.\nRub the paste generously onto a corn or callus, and wrap with a bandage to hold in place.\nLeave the paste on for at least 10 minutes, then rub the corn or callus with a pumice stone, and it should come off.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Naturally Remove Yucky Corns And Calluses END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Six of Roald Dahl's made-up words have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary to celebrate his centenary\n\nArticle: Roald Dahl is remembered for his solitary, kind-hearted child heroes—Charlie, who visited a chocolate factory, and Sophie, who befriended a floppy-eared giant, among them—and their triumphs over bullying adults. But the beloved British children’s book author was also known for the distinctive language he used to create the vivid, often dark, worlds in which the characters lived.\nTo honor the centenary of his birth this month, the Oxford English Dictionary has updated its latest edition today (Sept. 12) with six new words connected to Dahl’s writing, and revisions to six other phrases popularized by Dahl’s evocative stories. In May, the Oxford University Press also published a Roald Dahl Dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author.\nThere was linguistic method to Dahl’s mad use of language. \"He was using very linguistic principles,\" says Vineeta Gupta, head of children’s dictionaries at Oxford University Press. Dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as \"catasterous disastrophe\" from The BFG). Dahl also played with sound (\"sizzle-pan\" to refer to a frying pan in The BFG, for example).\nHere are the new Dahlisms added to the OED, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins.\nNew entries\nDahlesque The characteristics of Dahl’s work—in the OED’s words, \"eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour\"—now have their own adjective. The term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine Books Ireland.\nGolden ticket These refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). The first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter William Hogarth, giving him admission to the Vauxhall Gardens in London, in recognition of his paintings of the venue.\nHuman bean This is a mispronunciation of \"human being,\" uttered by the giant in The BFG (1982): \"We is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. The human bean is not a vegetable.\" The first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the British satirical magazine Punch in 1842.\nOompa Loompa The diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring Gene Wilder. Gupta called the phrase \"typical Dahlesque,\" reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning.\nScrumdiddlyumptious \"Extremely scrumptious\nexcellent, splendid\n(esp. of food) delicious.\" Although the word was first found in The American Thesaurus of Slang in 1942, Dahl’s giant’s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read The BFG: \"Every human bean is diddly and different. Some is scrumdiddlyumptious and some is uckyslush.\"\nWitching hour Referred to in The BFG as \"a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world to themselves.\" We can thank Shakespeare for this evocative phrase: according to the OED, \"witching time\" first appeared in Hamlet (1604).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Dahlesque\nGolden ticket\nHuman bean\nOompa Loompa\nScrumdiddlyumptious END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The most unexpected country that rocks at making olive oil\n\nArticle: Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country. Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words \"traffic jam\" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some \"liquid gold.\"\nBeing Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece.\nThe best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.\nThe Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act.\nAs we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.\nWe took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.\nThe final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled.\nIn Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Peloponnese END"}

Both our iPhone and Android apps have had multiple releases, and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\nWe’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.\nAs it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off\nwe announced Promoted User Posts\nand we announced tests we’ll be running on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\nYesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\nWe’ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.\nHappy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul\nnew frontpage algorithm\nwe tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off\nwe announced Promoted User Posts\nsponsored headlines END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s what happens when schools let transgender students use the bathroom they want\n\nArticle: At least once a day, Pam Retzlaff answered a call from parents concerned about her decision to allow a transgender student at Edgar Road Elementary School to use a bathroom different from his biological gender.\n\"It was hard in the beginning, very hard,\" she said. \"You can imagine my first open house. I had more parents in my office than ever before.\"\nIt was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn’t open the bathroom.\nAnd as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month. \nThat was more than two years ago – a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male – yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students. \nEven before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month’s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.\nOpponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it’s an issue of safety for non-transgender students.\nIn reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety. \nAccording to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity – second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias.\nAlthough some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease. \nAnd students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change.\nEliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do.\n\"If they were listening to local authorities,\" she said, \"they’d get out of the way.\"\nAtherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems. \n\"The most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we’ve been doing for the past two years,\" Aberli said in an interview.\nDespite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn’t happened at Atherton.\n\"We have several transgender students now,\" he said. \"It’s just kind of a non-issue.\"\nIn March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren’t required to use it, though some choose to do so.\n\"I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,\" Tokarz said.\nIn Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, \"but it just didn’t happen.\" \nThe 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said.\nIn response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another. \n\"Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,\" she said. \"We just don’t accept that kind of intolerance.\"\nBut the backlash is only beginning elsewhere.\nIn Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth’s school superintendent, over the district’s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it \"social engineering.\"\nTexas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration’s policy. \nLast month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities.\nThe department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds. \nIn a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school’s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity. \nNevertheless, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last month, with Mississippi, Kentucky and Kansas later joining the effort.\nThis month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration’s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students.\nAccording to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network’s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did.\nFour in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted.\nThe majority of students surveyed said they didn’t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse.\nSome schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment.\n\"This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,\" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAlthough he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn’t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available. \nThe school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February. Students can still choose what works best for them.\n\"Those little things make a huge difference in a student’s day\nthey’re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,\" Biggs said. \"We wanted to make that possible.\" \nStudent Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior. \nHernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school’s existing bathrooms. He’d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment.\n\"There’d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,\" he said in an interview.\nThe concerns weren’t unfounded. Jose Lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the Los Angeles school’s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest.\n\"There were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he’s a pedophile,\" Lara said.\nBut ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan.\n\"The students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change,\" Lara said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How One Theory You Never Heard of Explains Everything Donald Trump Does\n\nArticle: When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had \"a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with Macaulay Culkin—or playing in the NBA Finals—than winning the Republican nomination.\"\nWith a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and \"exactly zero\" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls?\nTo try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits.\nThe reality is that Trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility.\nThe Overton Window: When You Think About It, It’s So True...\nThis theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window.\nFor example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window.\nTrump’s Public Policy, Explained\nWith this in mind, now consider Trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons.\nThis wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that Trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA—which endorsed him—said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\"\nUsing the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage\nIt is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters.\nThe lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the Overton Window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Overton Window END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: BREAKING: This State Just Banned the Sale of ALL Semi-Auto Rifles, Effective Immediately\n\nArticle: Well, we all knew it was coming. You can’t have a \"mass shooting\" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today.\nThe Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun’s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it’s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.\nYes, you’ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an \"assault\" is now strictly illegal.\nWhat about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners?\nWe recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.\nRight. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests–they’re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. I could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but I wouldn’t want to let the wind out of the AG’s sail.\nIn the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. If Washington won’t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.\nWait–to get the guns off the street? I thought she’d just said it was legal to own them if you’d bought them before Wednesday.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: 15 of the most powerful women in the weed industry\n\nArticle: Despite Donald Trump's devastating Election Day win that put most of the country into a tailspin, cannabis supporters had one to celebrate this year, as eight states legalized weed for medicinal or recreational use. But as Trump's win proved true in politics, the cannabis industry, too, is riddled with white men in power—even if they aren't the ones who deserve all the credit. Women—from researchers studying the benefits of cannabis over opiates, to award-winning chefs cooking up the most delicious edibles on the planet, to those who are facing massive jail time for activism and legalization efforts—are the true heroes of the cannabis industry, and it’s time to recognize that. To celebrate women in weed, we spoke to 15 of the most powerful and influential women in the business:\n1. Dr. Lakisha Jenkins, Master Herbalist\nDr. Lakisha Jenkins has a doctorate in naturopathy, is a member of the American Herbalist Guild, and is a master herbalist, and founding board member of the California Cannabis Industry Association. Beyond helping write the legalization laws that just passed in the state of California, Dr. Jenkins can take 500 varieties of herbs and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ails you. If you love pot and natural medicine, she’s someone you want to know.\nUnfortunately, despite the abundance of healing Dr. Jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. \"My oldest daughter Kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and I questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her,\" explains Dr. Jenkins. \"I was informed that the State of California knows what’s better for my daughter than I do and that if I did anything different than conventional treatment, then I’d be acting outside of medical advice and that I would be a threat to her. Unfortunately, I was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, I started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives.\"\nKiona passed away in January 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. Dr. Jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques.\n\"My family is from the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians, so we have Native American lineage and my grandfather is a native healer,\" she explains. \"I just went back to my native roots and just researched.\" Along with her work as a healer, Dr. Jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege.\n\"There’s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don’t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you’re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry,\" explains Dr. Jenkins, who has also been a part of the Minority Business Council for three years.\nHer advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? \"Be fearless and strong in your conviction. Know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don’t let anything get in your way. Surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what’s going to help you persevere. Because people are going to challenge you all the time. But if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you’ll be taken seriously.\"\n2. Rachel K. Gillette, Attorney\nAn unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones, if you work with weed, you'll likely need a lawyer at some point. That’s where Rachel Gillette comes in\nan attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. Her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of Colorado.\n\"I’ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana,\" says Gillette. \"So in 2010, when I saw the state of Colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, I decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises.\" At the time, Gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. However, Gillette’s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry.\nGillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving \"We’re doing something that has never been done before, so there’s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended,\" she explains. Not to mention, working to help victims of America’s War On Drugs: \"We’ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn’t stand for that anymore.\"\n3. Lynne Lyman, California State Director for the Drug Policy Alliance\nWhile California cannabis users celebrate their state’s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment, (nice Hollyweed sign), Lynne Lyman’s work is just getting started. She's the California state director of the non-profit organization Drug Policy Alliance, \"the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights.\"\n\"We always say November 8th wasn’t the end, it was the beginning,\" she explains. \"That’s true with most laws\noften policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that’s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn’t get implemented, then it’s as if it didn’t pass.\"\nAlong with working to fund cannabis research, Lyman’s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society.\n\"You’re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they’re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary,\" Lyman explains. \"The advice I give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. There’s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it’s just any other industry. I want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they’ve had their families destroyed. Making sure you’re a good neighbor, and you’re working with the community that you are based in.\"\nLyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn't mean they're the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. \"One thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it’s been men’s faces at the forefront and yet it’s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work,\" explains Lyman. \"I’m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. You have to find a way to expand and let other people in. That’s a policy priority for DPA.\"\n4. Charlo Greene, Founder of Alaska Cannabis Club\nYou may remember Charlo Greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of Alaska Cannabis Club. Now living in Los Angeles, Greene says, \"I’m Charlo \"Fuck it, I quit\" Greene, and I’m credited with the legalization of marijuana in Alaska.\" An exceptional entrepreneur, she’s also behind NewCannabisTimes.com and the founder of Go Greene, a cannabis diversity summit series.\n\"I use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge, experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry, and make it mean something for them and their communities,\" says Greene. \"I think a lot of the work that I’m doing is overlooked because I am a woman and because I am a person of color.\"\nGreene’s success has come with a heavy price that proves the War on Drugs in far from over. \"I’m facing 54 years for creating the Alaska Cannabis Club, so in the meantime, it’s dreary that my life could be over this year,\" she explains. \"But if I stop doing what I know I am here to do, which is share these amazing stories and activate people, then the state has already won.\"\nGreene adds that she didn’t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it, but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy: \"There was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and I knew that was me. So I’m gonna continue what I’m doing, just on my own terms with The Weed Show.\"\nHer next court appearance is January 11, and she’s assembled a top-notch legal\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is what happens when the government tries to grow weed. (Hint: It ain’t good.)\n\nArticle: In the age of stickiest-of-ickiest-and-rising THC percentages, it appears the United States government still supplies researchers with low grade brick weed you probably smoked in high school. Actually, it's worse than the weed you smoked in high school. \nAccording to reports from PBS and the Washington Post, all marijuana used in research must be supplied by the federal government, and the pot that the government has been handing out looks like trash. \nGovernment marijuana looks nothing like the real stuff. See for yourself. https://t.co/UKNSYwqPWQ pic.twitter.com/IbQv8p5NWu\n— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 13, 2017\nThough it's relatively simple to grow, the quality of cannabis you can purchase (legally or illegally) in the United States can vary greatly. Lighting, air quality, humidity and pests can all play a massive role in the end product, so growing weed may be pretty easy, but growing great weed can be pretty taxing. \nAs the Post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. But the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in Denver. Or getting from an illegal delivery service in New York City. \nAnd while weed comes in plenty of colors, shapes, densities and sizes, the pot analyzed by PBS and the Post looks extremely yellow and filled with stems.\nSue Sisley, a researcher with MAPS studying the medical effects of marijuana on U.S. veterans suffering from PTSD told PBS the weed supplied to them for the study doesn't even smell like weed.\n'It doesn’t resemble cannabis. It doesn’t smell like cannabis.'\n\"It doesn’t resemble cannabis. It doesn’t smell like cannabis,\" she said.\nNot only is the weed bad, but Sisley claims it was moldy as well. So the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot.\nAll of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the University of Mississippi. The farm is run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is the only facility licensed by the DEA to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the DEA. (It's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.)\nRick Doblin, MAPS’ director, blasted NIDA's capabilities by telling PBS, \"They’re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we’re hoping to be approved by the FDA as prescription medicine. \"\nWhen confronted about the mold and potency, NIDA and the University of Mississippi told PBS that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped.\nSisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in Colorado as a part of typical protocol. There they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. One sample was supposed to contain 13 percent THC — it reportedly had just 8 percent. \nShockingly, 13 percent THC is the highest percentage NIDA offers. In Colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent. \nNIDA blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn't handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. MAPS fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts \"were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing,\" according to PBS.\nWhile it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the United States needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. Regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't. \nThough there way may be hope on the horizon: The DEA announced in the summer that it would start to allow other bulk growers the ability to provide cannabis for medical research, though none have yet been approved. \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Not only is the weed bad, but Sisley claims it was moldy as well END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Top 5 Free and Open Source Inventory Management Software Systems\n\nArticle: Managing your inventory effectively can be the difference between making the sale and losing it to a competitor. If you don’t know what you have or where it is, you’re going to have a tough time selling it.\nLuckily, you don’t have to go broke just keeping an eye on your product. Here are five free or open source inventory management offerings for small businesses.\ninFlow is an inventory management software focused on small and medium businesses. The company has been growing since 2007 and now claims over 750,000 users. inFlow has a free option that limits you to 100 products and customers, and a baker’s dozen reports. You also miss out on some advanced user features and inventory management options.\nThe free version has no expiration, though, and small businesses will be well-served by the small set of options. Default features include barcoding, different accounting methods, and automatic data backup, among others.\nOnce you outgrow the free version, inFlow can be upgraded for a one-off, $399 payment. That will unlock unlimited products and customers, more reports, and advanced features like customized invoices and order forms. Paying customers also get a year of support.\nCarta is the online offering from the people who brought you inFlow. Carta also offers a slimmed down free version. Carta’s limitations are based on the number of sales per month that can be processed — at the free level, it’s a mere 10.\nLuckily, every level is currently free since Carta is still in its beta testing phase. You might have a few hiccups along the way, but you can get the $99 per month package for free, right now. The company anticipates the free betas running through the end of 2015, so you’ll have plenty of time to figure out which package works for you.\nCarta includes some interesting options for collaboration with buyers and sellers, so you can assist folks through the ordering process. With the background from inFlow, Carta should offer you everything a small business needs.\nRightcontrol Lite provides inventory management for ten product lines. It also comes with invoice and receipt generation tools, geared toward the small business or self-employed individual. Apart from a limitation on product lines, the Lite flavor offers all the features of its bigger sisters and brothers in the Rightcontrol line.\nUsers can set automatic reorder reminders when stock gets low, can print labels for stock, and can integrate with a barcode system. If you need more than the ten products or want more users, growing businesses can upgrade to Rightcontol Solo, Pro, or Workgroup for about $1.50, $7.50, or $30 per month — the company’s rates are given in British Pounds. Each comes with an increase in the number of products that can be managed.\nWe’ve talked about Odoo here before , but it’s because there’s a lot to like. For two people using the online system, Odoo is free. If you download the open source version and host it yourself, Odoo can be free for everyone, though you’ll have to support it yourself.\nOdoo is designed as an ERP, but thanks to the software’s add-on app layout, you can make it as large or small as your business requires. For inventory management, you’ll probably want to take advantage of at least the warehouse management system and perhaps the purchase or point of sales system as well.\nSince it’s an ERP, all of your data will be combined in the backend, so purchases can flow into inventory and into your accounting, as well. Odoo online can be a great open source answer for a small business, while larger businesses can get a lot out of the full featured software.\nABC Inventory is the child of Almyta Control System. It’s a free package for a single user, allowing you to manage multiple warehouses, serial numbers, warranties, and a host of other inventory related data. This free version is really designed to be run on one computer, though, as multiple workstations can’t sync the same data.\nAs with almost all free options, you’ll be supplying the support — though there are some forums to give you a hand if things get tough. ABC is geared specifically toward smaller companies that don’t need all the bells and whistles that come with a bigger system.\nFinal thoughts\nAll of these systems can manage most small business inventory requirements, with many offering flexibility to move up as your company grows. Odoo may have the strongest position for an existing large company, but the low prices for its competitors mean that there are plenty of options within most budgets.\nWhat other free inventory software solutions are out there? Let us know in the comments!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " inFlow\nCarta\nRightcontrol Lite\nOdoo\nABC Inventory END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s\n\nArticle: Look at a photo of a street scene from the '70s or early '80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. Most of the buildings are similar. People's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads.\nOne thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today.\nThis underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models — like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right):\nIn the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift?\nIt turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes.\nIt all started with European luxury designs\nBy the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea — it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance.\nBut the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk.\nIn Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in Germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors.\nOne of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963:\nThis aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, \"American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.\"\nFord, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era:\nReviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the \"jelly mould\"), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars.\nIn the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack — who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus:\nIt might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, \"was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.\"\nThe strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat American cars.\nAutomakers had to improve fuel economy\nPart of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed.\nRight as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon.\nWhile automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. \"One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,\" Gartman writes.\nAutomakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. \"They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,\" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history.\nTechnology made it easier to produce curves\nA few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier.\nFor decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models.\n\"It's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,\" Sparke says. \"They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.\" Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before.\nAs a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB.\nSure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s — and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus.\nVerge Video: This is the driverless future Mercedes Benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: This 'sad' advice a male VC just gave to women in tech couldn't be more wrong\n\nArticle: The good news is that a male venture capitalist thinks he has an innovative new solution to solve the gender gap in tech. The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men.\nIn a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are.\n\"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It’s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it’s also personality and warmth.\"\nI sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.]\nHeidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn’t know if they were male or female.\n\"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\"\nNimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can’t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine’ advice.\n\"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\"\nThe fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year’s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference’s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority.\n\"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\"\nAs a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " pretending that they are men END"}

That’s a difference of more than 2,500 years.\n2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us.\nEven in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us.\n3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us.\nNot only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out.\n4. The oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the US Constitution than to today.\nEmma Morano-Martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. That’s 112 years after the signing of the Constitution, which was signed in 1787.\n5. The 10th president of the United States has two grandchildren who are alive today.\nJohn Tyler had a son, Lyon Tyler, at age 63. Lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including Lyon Tyler Jr. and Harrison Tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties.\n6. Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization.\nOxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. By most accounts, the Aztecs didn’t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century.\n7. Harvard University was founded before Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity.\nWhile not nearly as old as Oxford, Harvard is still an old university. It was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before Isaac Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.\n8. We made it to the moon only 66 years after the Wright brothers invented human flight.\nThe Wright brothers’ first flight was in 1903, and the Apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. There’s so much Americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with Russia.\n9. Woolly mammoths were still alive when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built.\nIn fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn’t until about 1560 BCE.\n10. When the first Star Wars movie came out, France was still executing people by guillotine.\nThe final execution by guillotine in France occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of Hamida Djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. That was the same year the first Star Wars movie hit theaters.\n11. When the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the Oregon Trail.\nThe first major wagon train hit the Oregon Trail in 1841. Just two years later, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine.\n12.

Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barbara Walters were all born in the same year.\nThough they’re often thought of as having lived in very different times, Anne Frank, Barbara Walters, and MLK Jr. were all born in 1929.\n18. Some of the world’s whales that are alive today were born before Moby-Dick was written.\nSome bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. Since Moby Dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book.\n19. Pluto didn’t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet.\nPluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, back in 1930. It was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. Because of its distance from the sun, Pluto takes 248 Earth-years to orbit the sun just once. That means it didn’t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet.\n20. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall than to today.\nThe Berlin Wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year.\n21.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?\n\nArticle: Protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business.\nOver the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.\nAt the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa’s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.\nWhile these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India’s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.\n\"We’re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\"\nGrig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions.\"\nAnnette Hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said.\nAside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.\nOne way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death,\" she said.\nMore broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. \"We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,\" she said.\nFinally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. \"The just war theory,\" she said, \"lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?\" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons.\nNo one has easy answers. \"Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,\" Grig said. She added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. \"I think this is something we need to be discussing,\" she said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: @AnnCoulter won't stop ranting about this\n\nArticle: Ann Coulter can’t stop raging against Hispanic voters.\nThe conservative pundit blasted House Republicans as \"sell outs\" in a column on Wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing Latino population will \"wreck the country.\"\n\"Leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans,\" Coulter writes. \"What does it mean for the Republican Party?\"\nCasting aside conventional wisdom, Coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the Republican Party lose voters. She argues that Latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly Asians, are so liberal on issues including Obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they’ll never vote in large numbers for Republicans.\nCoulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: \"The only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people.\" In fact, polls routinely show that a majority of Americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by House Republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence.\nTo back her assertions, Coulter cites a study by Phyllis Schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the Republicans to keep their party as white as possible.\nCoulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was \"too important to wait.\" The study was not provided in the column, so it’s not clear what new information it contained. Coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by Pew, Gallup, Latino Decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and Latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average U.S. citizen.\n\"The people that Republicans ought to reach out to are white voters,\" Schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show Focus Today. \"There is not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican.\nActually, there is. Former President George W. Bush pulled 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Avoiding the approach advocated by folks like Coulter or Schlafly, he spoke some Spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against Latinos during interviews with the media.\nMany observers have concluded that the Republican Party would perform better among Latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like Coulter. Instead, Coulter has argued since Barack Obama’s reelection as president in November that Republicans should ignore the country’s largest ethnic minority altogether.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hispanic voters END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant\n\nArticle: Here’s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student. (Courtesy Ashok Goel)\nTo help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff.\nBut, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.\nAshok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams.\nStudents were amazed. \"I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\" wrote one in the class’s online forum. \"Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\" said another.\nNow Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.\n\"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\"\nAt the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.\nGoel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.\nAs Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.\nTo train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.\nGoel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.\n\"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said.\nThe system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.\nThere are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.\nGoel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education.

There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body.\nWe are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why?

Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines.\nWhat Actually Are Those White Lines?\nThe answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals.\nWho Started This?\nPreviously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back.\nNow, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language.\nAre they harmful?\nAbsolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better.\nFollowed by?\nApple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: BBC Micro Bit computer becomes a commercial product\n\nArticle: Image caption The Micro Bit will be more than double the price of the Raspberry Pi Zero mini-computer\nThe BBC Micro Bit, the tiny computing device designed to get children coding, is going on sale to the general public.\nThe device is already being delivered, free, to one million Year 7 children in schools across the UK.\nNow it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for £12.99.\nCommercial availability of the Micro Bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device's manufacturer, the Leeds-based company, element 14.\nThe firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90.\nBut retailers including Microsoft, the Technology Will Save Us organisation and Sciencescope will offer individual devices.\nImage caption Owners of the Micro Bit can write code for it via a website designed by Microsoft\nElement 14 is part of Premier Farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful Raspberry Pi barebones computer. Richard Curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the Micro Bit.\n\"It's going to be huge,\" he told me.\"We've already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who've seen what has happened in the UK.\"\nThe Micro Bit was meant to be the flagship of the BBC's Make It Digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. It started arriving in schools this spring and the BBC says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 Year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds).\nWhile I have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers.\nMedia caption Rishworth School sent a Micro Bit into the stratosphere\nA number have told me that the Micro Bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - \"starting after half term, it's come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures\" was one comment this morning.\nBut another teacher said this: \"Got ours just before Easter hols. Kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc.\"\nIt is late in the year - although the Micro Bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays.\nImage caption Until now, only Year 7 schoolchildren in the UK had access to their own Micro Bits\nThe hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join Year 8 in September, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then.\nThe real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next Year 7 children will benefit from getting their own Micro Bits.\nThey could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again.\nElement 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy.\nThe Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices.\nBut if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " £12.99 END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Antibiotics will soon 'stop working'\n\nArticle: Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing \"terrible human and economic cost\", a major study has warned.\nResistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn.\nDrug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.\nResearch has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock.\nAntibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe\n4 show all Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe\n1/4 K. pneumoniaeis one of the toughest super-infections Alamy\n2/4 Amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by GPs\n3/4 Antibiotic resistance cycle\n4/4 Antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe\nThe report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK.\nLord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA)\nIt calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.\nThe report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.\nAntibiotics crisis is global\nLord O’Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\"\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\"\nDame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\"\nAntibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: There was one very important thing missing from the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast:\n\nArticle: LONDONDERRY, NEW HAMPSHIRE—Three clarifications from Marco Rubio's pancake breakfast Sunday morning.\nThe cardboard costumed Rubio-bots mechanically handing out broken gaskets were not New Hampshire voters.\nAt least 50 percent of the 800 or so attendees were not New Hampshire voters.\nThere were no pancakes at the pancake breakfast.\nSo went Marco Rubio's morning after, the morning after an Ambien-esque nightmare of a debate performance where Chris Christie repeatedly pounced on him for reciting the same anti-Obama talking point, nearly word for word, four times. \"There it is!\" gleeful scorekeeper Christie called on ball three, \"The memorized 25-second speech!\"\nLondonderry High School was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned Rubio's now-defining line, \"Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible.\nRubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate's debate performance was getting. \"I think it's a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,\" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. \"We're going to focus on President Obama.\" Any slip of the gears isn't going to affect Tuesday's results. \"We have a very strong ground game.\"\nMerrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. \"I don't know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.\nNot everyone—especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast—was satisfied. \"It's the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast—so far we've had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\"\nHis wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. \"They waited for me to drive away,\" to make sure she didn't replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. \"Christie's people, they are street fighters.\"\nStill, she admitted, it's been difficult to predict how things are going. \"I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,\" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, \"I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night...\" she gave a little shrug. \"I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.\"\nDurant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. \"There are ten of us here,\" she noted, \"and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter.\" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He's still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she's undecided, too.\nWhen Rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. \"A couple of housekeeping items,\" were the first words out of his mouth. \"We couldn't figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people—I hope they fed you.\"\nIt didn't get better. He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I'm going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\"\nThings perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\"\nRubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' Well, it won't do that either.\"\nBut afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio's response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt. Dan Kipnis, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. Capt. Dan Kipnis, member of the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force. Capt. Dan Kipnis, Director-at-Large, Florida Wildlife Federation. Capt. Dan Kipnis, adviser to former vice president Al Gore. Capt. Dan Kipnis, who has been trying to bring Marco Rubio to the climate change table for nearly 10 years now.\nAs the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, Merrill's \"very strong ground game\" was in action. Two young Rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an \"I Pledge to Vote for Rubio\" The responses:\nI'm not from here.\nNo, New York.\nI'm from out of state.\nWe're from Connecticut.\nWe just came up from Massachusetts.\n\"Thank you for making the drive,\" one volunteer repeatedly responded. It grew a little wearying. \"Nobody is,\" he started, and then corrected himself, \"There are a few people from New Hampshire.\"\nWatching from a ledge behind him was Kaity Thomson, a recent University of New Hampshire graduate, who'd come to hear Rubio with her co-worker and friend Yuxi Wang. \"We were expecting pancakes,\" said Thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. \"It's crazy.\" Thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: \"The visiting captain's story ... I think it was really moving and inspiring.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " pancakes END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Body language expert reveals nine ways to spot a liar\n\nArticle: There's nothing worse than having the wool pulled over your eyes, and when it happens you often wonder how someone managed to deceive you. \nNow body language expert Judi James has revealed the key signs to look out for if you're concerned someone is being economical with the truth. \nWhile she warns that there is 'no set formula' for spotting a liar, recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber. \n'Forget all those claims of \"tells\" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth. \n'A bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting,' she explained. \n'But a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool, calm and confident. \n'Despite the fact there are no \"one-size-fits-all\" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone’s not being totally honest with you.'\nThe big pause: Lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. First your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie. \nThis often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like ‘Why do you ask that?’ rather than a direct and open response.\nThe eye dart: Humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we’re trying to hide something. \nWhen we look up to our left to think we’re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. Also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away.\nThe lost breath: Bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated. \nThe mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard.\nOvercompensating: A liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. These over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) and over-emphatic gesticulation.\nThe poker face: Although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they’re being economical with the truth.\nThe face hide: When someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. This can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover.\nSelf-comfort touches: The stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. We all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing.\nMicro-gestures: These are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. Experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie. \nThe best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. The mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away.\nHeckling hands: The hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie. \nWhen the gestures and the words are at odds it’s called incongruent gesticulation and it’s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth.\nJudi James is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s new Murder Mystery fundraising game Whodunnit? and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part. \n'While I don’t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said. \nConvince yourself first: The brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Overwatch Has a Secret Character And She’s Going To Be Revealed Soon\n\nArticle: Overwatch Has a Secret Character And She’s Going To Be Revealed Soon\nA new character might be on its way for joining the Overwatch roster soon. Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together.\nA story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon.\nTo start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes.\nPointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, \"Way back in November, people noticed that there’s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76/Jack Morrison and Sombra. Given Soldier 76 is Jack Morrison, this only leaves the mysterious Sombra file, which would fit with a Soldier 76 vs. Sombra animated short.\"\nSombra has also made several appearances in various stages. She wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper.\nNirolak also mentioned about Reaper’s dialogue in the game where he says, \"Where is Sombra when you need her?\", which can be another massive hint.\nApart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon.\nThere are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.\nAt this point we can certainly say that there’s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it’ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.\nWe’ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Hollywood didn't want to make this Vin Diesel movie\n\nArticle: Filmmaking in 2013: \"Riddick,\" the third Vin Diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature. That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here?\nLet's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.\nMaybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.\nDid you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed?\nYeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo.\nVin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.\nLook, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for.\nI enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it.\nAnd look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.\nThe first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him.\nThat's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\"\nWhy did you want to do that?\nBecause he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him.\nDo you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made?\nYes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story?\nI do not.\nIt goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.\nSo, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.\nSo Universal didn't put any money into the film?\nThey put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.\nSo Riddick is an indie film?\nHere's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. So, very pure filmmaking. Very pure.\nMike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " third \"Riddick\" movie END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Man Purchases Harley-Davidson Motercycle. His reason is unbelievable!...\n\nArticle: LINCOLN, Neb. — A 34-year-old Lincoln man purchased a 2012 Harley-Davidson Softail Slim motorcycle this past Tuesday in an effort to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists.\nRussell \"Rusty\" Brandt entered Frontier Harley-Davidson’s front door around 11 a.m. with more than a thousand dollars in his wallet. A few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle.\n\"I learned to ride when I lived in Creighton, and there weren’t many people there. Sometimes I would see people I didn’t know, and they would wave to me. I didn’t even put two and two together that they were waving at me just because I was on a motorcycle,\" Brandt explained. \"It probably happened half a dozen times in two years. I moved here to Lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot. They expect you to wave back. It’s almost like a religion.\"\nBrandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase. He rode in on a 2012 Honda Shadow, which he traded in to Frontier Harley-Davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle.\n\"When you ride a Harley, you just don’t have to wave,\" Brandt said. \"If a guy on a Suzuki doesn’t wave, you have to wonder if he didn’t see you, or if he was using the clutch. Maybe he was having a bad day, but you don’t want to assume that, because you really don’t even know the other rider. But when you see a Harley, you know why the guy on it doesn’t wave. It’s because he’s on a Harley. In fact, guys on the Harley machines don’t even wave to riders on other Harleys!\"\nWhen asked about the inconvenience of having to trade in his motorcycle for a bike of another marque and the resulting monetary loss, Brandt was able to put things into perspective in terms of a simple cost-benefit analysis.\n\"The Shadow was a really good bike. Really good. I mean, I didn’t even want to get rid of it, but let’s get right down to the nitty-gritty. You don’t have to wave if you’re on a Harley. I just want to take some of the pressure off when I want to go out for a ride, and if I have to cough up some money to do that, so be it. It will be worth it.\"\nBrandt mentioned some safety aspects that he says other riders don’t consider. Safety was a big consideration in his decision to purchase the big Harley machine.\n\"Last week, I didn’t wave to a guy I passed on the left. I was in the middle of shifting gears, and didn’t think about it. About a mile later, I’m stopped at a red light, and the guy comes up to me and starts interrogating me about why I didn’t return his wave. He was really losing it. I went right home and told my wife. I told her I was trading the bike. I have a family. I can’t have people I don’t know coming up to me and yelling at me unannounced.\"\nStill, Brandt remained positive about his future in motorcycling.\n\"It’s really not that big of a deal. I wanted a new bike anyway.\"\nSource: revzilla\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Guess which famous Andy Warhol painting could fetch $60 million this fall\n\nArticle: It may just look like a simple, retro Coca Cola advertisement -- and hey, it basically is -- but the familiar black-and-white pop piece is actually an iconic painting by the one and only Andy Warhol. And before you start thinking, \"Hey, that poster would look fantastic in my bedroom,\" you might want to check the price tag.\nYes, you read that right. It could set you back up to $60 million.\nCreated in 1962, the massive, human-sized canvas is heading to auction in New York City this fall, as part of Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art sale. The work had been housed in a previous collection for the past two decades, making cameo appearances at almost every Warhol retrospective in recent memory, Christie's explained in a press statement. But the stark soda masterpiece is officially up for grabs on November 12, 2013. That is, if you have $40 to $60 million sitting around.\n\"What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,\" Andy Warhol once quipped. \"You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca Cola, too.\"\nBut if you happen to catch sight of Warhol's \"Coca-Cola (3)\" -- which will be on view in London from October 12-18, don't be fooled. We're pretty sure only the wealthiest of consumers can afford this one. Warhol is probably high fiving a million angels as he contemplates the irony of his own fate.\nStay tuned to see how much the painting reels in.

But in truth, creating this protective paper barrier could be doing you way more harm than good.\nStudies have found that where we perceive bacteria thriving in bathrooms can be completely backwards, and what we use to keep us clean could actually be spreading the problem around!\nRead below to learn how bacteria is spread in all bathrooms, and what steps we should be taking to keep scary bathroom germs at bay!\nThere is a general misconception that covering toilet seats keeps you safe from germs.\nBut toilet seats are actually designed to keep as much bacteria off of you as possible.\nAccording to Today.com, germs are not easily spreadable on toilet seats, since many different bacteria and viruses don’t survive long outside of a human body.\nTheir special shape and material were specifically designed to prevent bacteria from dwelling on their surface for very long.\nDespite this, many people opt to line the seat with toilet paper — but really, this seemingly clean practice may actually be increasing your exposure to germs.\nToilet paper, unlike toilet seats, are not designed to ward off bacteria.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s the secret way people are using Snapchat Spectacles. \n(Hint: sex)\n\nArticle: When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles—his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses—in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\"\nThere's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy.\nOf course, behind closed doors, it's already happened.\n\"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.)\nSEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles\nRachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York.\n\"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\"\nSnap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages—the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have—made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun.\nTo wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"—which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone—\"was really cool.\"\n\"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's.\nThe idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles—photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless.\nyou have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com/klm9kZM7B2\n— Damon Beres ✨ (@dlberes) September 24, 2016\nHow will sex tapes change after Spectacles?\n— Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016\nSnapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com/QosgVH3j9e\n— Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016\nBut you know what they say—there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming.\nGiven the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy.\nYet—most of them have at least had the idea.\n\"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained.\n\"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\"\nOf course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed.\nOf the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex.\n\"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said.\n\"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\"\nThe experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times.\n\"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said.\nIt wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious.\n\"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn’t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said.\nJennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows—literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself.\n\"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"—the color of her Spectacles—\"was a bad choice,\" she said.\n\"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\"\nA series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend.\nWhile Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story.\nThey don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder.\n\"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said.\nRichard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July.\nAs for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still—and isn't unlikely to—show up in the near future.\nJesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there’s a new gadget, we’re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said.\nHis company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013.\n\"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\"\nSnap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How Trump could win.\n\nArticle: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\nAt this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump’s campaign. He’s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There’s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House—that he’s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses.\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.\nAt least, that’s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren’t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn’t mean he couldn’t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn’t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions?\nAt the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it’s possible that \"popularity\" just won’t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates’ worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump.\nLet’s say you don’t trust the models (they couldn’t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat—let’s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively—and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn’t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.)\nHow would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers.\nIt’s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan’s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama.\nIn other words, it’s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it’s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It’s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it’s possible.\nOK, OK. \"Possible\" doesn’t mean \"likely,\" and it’s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney’s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it’s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won.\nIt’s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy’s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there’s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We’re due. One is all we need for President Trump.\nA terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let’s table this one.\nThere’s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It’s why the \"Never Trump\" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it’s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton’s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders’ backers who haven’t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it’s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won’t be.\nWith all this said, even the most probable scenario here—that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot. They’re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election—partisanship, demographics, and economic performance—to create favorable terrain for Democrats.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " a national catastrophe.\na recession.\nA terrorist attack\na divided Democratic Party.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Facebook Is Building Apartments Anyone Can Rent—But There's a Huge Catch\n\nArticle: Image: Getty\nFacebook could be your next landlord. In an effort to drum up support for the controversial expansion of its headquarters, the social media giant is trying to give back to the community by building at least 1,500 housing units that can be rented by the general public—not just Facebook employees.\nBut there’s a catch. As Facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive PR agenda to convince people that Facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate. Facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families. Which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros.\nFacebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years. This January, the World Bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. \"Some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks,\" the report said. \"Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.\"\nThat’s exactly what happened when Facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the Menlo Park area, where its headquarters is located. Most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. Obviously, that doesn’t win Mark Zuckerberg many new friends in the area.\nMeanwhile, Facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it’s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. Secondly, it’s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. Despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: Facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it’s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can’t afford the rent.\nSponsored\nThis isn’t the first time Facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. In 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare.\nAt the time, a Wall Street Journal report referred to the project as being similar to a \"company town,\" the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. The employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. Towns like Pullman, Illinois were created as \"capitalist utopias.\" But ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents.\nIs Facebook turning Menlo Park into a 21st century version of Pullman? It’s too soon to tell. The new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on Facebook’s part. But while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it’s surely won’t be enough to fix the area’s greater socioeconomic problems.\n[Wall Street Journal]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families END"}

It will suck sometimes.\nAnd do you know what else they don’t tell you? It’s OK that marriage is hard and sucky sometimes. You will be OK. Your marriage will be OK.\nHere’s a few other things no one tells you about marriage, the things that no one writes in your bridal shower scrapbook of clichéd-crock-of-shit advice:\nThere will be fights.\nYou will fight about big things and little things and things you don’t even care about. You will fight about whether to shop at Walmart or Costco, about whether your son needs a haircut, and whether your Aunt Josie is a racist or just an idiot. You will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team. You will have drop-down, drag-out brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down. And you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little \"needy.\"\nThere will be anger.\nIn fact, you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing. You might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night—again!—to feed the baby, get the toddler a drink of water, or calm the big kid after a scary dream. You might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas—again!—and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes round-trip to pick her up.\nThere will be score-keeping.\nYou will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours. You will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote. You measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons, and who spends more hours working in a dead-end job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. You will keep score of the number of socks on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and toilet paper rolls unchanged.\nAnd there will be hard times.\nAnd not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids, the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy make-up sex. No. Marriage is really fucking hard sometimes.\nBut here’s something else no one might have told you: It’s OK that marriage is hard.\nBecause even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times, marriage is pretty fucking great. The truth is, some of the most amazing things in life—marriage and parenting among them—are really hard work. Marriage is not all heart-shaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop. Marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon. And marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on Facebook with words like \"soul mates\" and \"#soblessed.\"\nMarriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. Because when you share your freaking life with someone else—raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing Netflix shows—it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then.\nBut you will get through it. You will remember that you’re on the same team. You will fight, and then you will forgive. You will compromise. You will get therapy if you need to. You will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves.\nSo fear not, you are not alone. Marriage is hard for everyone now and then.

They may have said that last year too.)\nThe other reasons given confirm that many U.S. workers feel bound to their jobs.\nAbout a quarter of workers say they simply work too much and can't afford to take time off, while just over 15 percent say they actively enjoy working and prefer it to vacation.\nIt's good to remember that more time on the job doesn't necessarily translate to better performance at the job.\n\"Without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick — all of which have a direct impact on their work performance,\" says Sarah Berger, personal finance expert and \"The Cashlorette\" at Bankrate.com.\nSo consider taking your vacation, even if you just recharge at home. But if you can't, and would still like a way to de-stress in your off hours, consider taking up a hobby.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Rio ratings are terrible\n\nArticle: Michael Phelps. Photo: Adam Pretty\nCritics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC ’s early coverage of the Rio Olympics — and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock’s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It’s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday’s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor.\nThe first sign of trouble for NBC ’s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday’s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that’s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer’s No. 1 series, NBC ’s America’s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC ’s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating.\nThings didn’t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London’s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC ’s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren’t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday’s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC ’s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network’s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won’t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called \"total audience\" measurement data later this week.\nIt’s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC ’s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday’s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps — telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences — delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network’s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What’s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney. If Team USA can keep winning, NBC still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the Games.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why Russia has two St. Patrick’s days this year\n\nArticle: Informally, Russia has long marked St. Patrick's Day, joining the rest of the world in the March 17 celebration of Irish culture that includes lots of green and lots of drinking. This year, however, the Russian Orthodox Church is doing something different.\nIt's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time — but on March 30.\nEarlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West.\nDespite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync.\nThis means that the day of St. Patrick's death — March 17 in the Gregorian calendar — falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church.\nThe March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them. Russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. More than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in Moscow, which will take place on March 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to Ireland that take place March 15 to 26.\nIn a statement given to the Govorit Moskva radio station, the Irish government said it was glad the Russian Orthodox Church had made the decision. \"We hope to see our friends in Moscow on all of our Irish events in the next two weeks,\" said Arthur Hendrick, consul at the Irish Embassy in Moscow.\nFor members of the Orthodox faith, celebrating two St. Patrick's days may not be an option: March 17 falls in the middle of the Orthodox observance of Lent, when many religious Russians abstain from alcohol. Father Igor Fomin, head of a church at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, told Tass news agency that getting drunk in honor of a saint is like being heavily intoxicated at your mother’s gravesite.\n\"I am very happy that our St. Patrick’s Day falls on a different date, that way the traditions associated with it, that are strictly cultural and not religious can be ignored,\" Fomin said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This means that the day of St. Patrick's death — March 17 in the Gregorian calendar — falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Gene Wilder Agreed To Play Willy Wonka Under This One Condition\n\nArticle: \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is one of those movies that transcends time.\nThe original film, released in 1971 and directed by Mel Stuart, starred the late screen icon Gene Wilder as the titular Willy Wonka. Wilder died at the age of 83 on Sunday, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease at his home in Stamford, Connecticut.\nWithout Wilder the film may have been good, but with him, it was wonderful. As it turns out, however, the actor wasn’t always sold on the role. In fact, he only agreed to play the famous candyman under one condition.\nAs reported by Letters of Note, Wilder told Stuart:\n\"When I make my first entrance. I’d like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I’m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\"\nWhen asked why he wanted to do this, Wilder simply said, \"Because from that time on, no one will know if I’m lying or telling the truth.\"\nWilder wanted Wonka to be completely unpredictable, and as we all know, he got his wish. The scene featuring Wonka’s grand entrance is one of the most memorable in the film, thanks to Wilder’s imagination and creativity.\nWilder also provided some input about Wonka’s costume after seeing the first sketches. According to Letters of Note, the actor wrote a letter to Stuart offering up some suggestions for the character’s signature look.\n\"I don’t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy’s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric — where there’s no telling what he’ll do or where he ever found his get-up — except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another,\" he wrote, adding, \"A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The strange word everyone is saying/texting\n\nArticle: Not long after noticing friends and coworkers using \"slash\" in everyday conversation, I started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time.\nEither spelled out in five characters (\"slash\") or just one (\"/\"), I saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways. But they weren't.\nIt was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.\nAfter so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8/30/2014\") and fractions (\"3/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.\nGrammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.\nEnglish speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"\n\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.\n\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"\nUsage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"\nTell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"\nWhile it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.\nThe slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")\nIn digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China.\nBreakfast slash lunch! Yum! @ Max's Restaurant, SM Mall of Asia http://t.co/oSSwgVkLA4 — Uriel Yu Medellin (@itsmeuriel) August 4, 2014\nBut will it stick around?\nWe can't say. To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members.\"\nCorrection: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

He’s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he’ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.\nOh, and then there are his hands. \"As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,\" he admits. \"I had small hands. They were like a girl’s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.\" When he goes to a meet-up he’s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: \"I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. ‘What do you think about these?’ I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, ‘Oh, so beautiful!’\"\nMoshfegh’s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They’re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they’re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt.\nIn one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: \"He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. ‘I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?’ She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.\"\nIn a story called \"The Beach Boy,\" a man’s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it’s out of focus and context-free, he’s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he’s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he’s now certain was unfaithful. \"Marcia was gone for good now,\" Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, \"and he felt like celebrating.\"\nThe women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women’s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: \"I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.\" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job.\nThe unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh’s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into \"good\" and \"bad.\" Moshfegh’s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people. \nReading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom \"Peep Show.\" There’s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It’s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it’s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh’s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we’re not such an elevated species as we’d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast. \nThe Bottom Line:\nMoshfegh’s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore.\nWhat other reviewers think:\nThe New York Times: \"If there’s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it’s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes.\"\nNPR: \"There’s not a story in Homesick for Another World that’s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh’s talent is unique, and her characters — unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic — are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.\"\nWho wrote it?\nOttessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she’d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets.\nWho will read it?\nFans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters ― and readers who don’t mind being grossed out.\nOpening lines:\n\"My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns’ lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I’d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.\"\nNotable passage:\n\"Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She’d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose. She gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs.\n\"’Oh, shit,’ she said when she reached the landing. ‘I forgot the broom.’\"\nHomesick for Another World By Ottessa Moshfegh Penguin Press, $26.00 Published January 3, 2017\nThe Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " \"Malibu,\"\n\"The Beach Boy,\"\nHomesick for Another World\n END"}

Together, those countries own about $281 billion in U.S. debt, down from $298.4 billion in January.\nA Freedom of Information Act request filed by A Freedom of Information Act request filed by Bloomberg News led to the Treasury Department breaking down the assets by country. The U.S. started releasing data on foreign ownership of Treasuries in 1974, but had never specified how much Saudi Arabia holds.\nThe $116.8 billion Saudi Arabia owns puts it in the top 12 foreign nations with holdings of U.S. debt, falling between India and Singapore. Its total pales in comparison to China’s whopping $1.3 trillion and Japan’s $1.1 trillion.\nSaudi holdings of Treasuries peaked at $123.6 billion in January, the data released Monday show. The numbers were made public as part of the Treasury’s regular monthly reports.\nThe disclosure comes during an unusually tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations. Last month Saudi officials warned the country would sell off $750 billion worth of Treasuries and other assets in the states if Congress approved a bill that would allow the monarchy to be sued in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\nOfficials in Washington and Riyadh were already on edge because President Obama is said to be seriously considering declassifying 28 pages of a congressional report into the 2001 attacks that some say indicate the hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi Arabian, received support, explicit or otherwise, from the country’s vast royal family.\nIntelligence officials have been reviewing whether to make the pages public since 2014 and are due to deliver a recommendation to the president. Whatever the recommendation, the White House has said Obama could ultimately use his executive authority to make the pages public.\nThe Treasury Department’s disclosure answers one of the questions surrounding the relationship between the two countries and shows that the monarchy, while an important player in the U.S. financial system, doesn’t have as much leverage as many likely believed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " $117 billion END"}

I will forever live in the fear of finding out my parents have turned into pigs, perhaps somewhat irrationally, mostly because that detail was never clear to me after watching the movie fifteen years ago.\nBut today, unsettled viewers might be able to find some peace. Spirited Away fans have long speculated over the deeper meaning of fantastical moments in the film , and now we're finally getting some answers.\nTwitter user @0910noncha sent some questions about the film to Studio Ghibli earlier this year, and to her delight, she got a thoughtful reply from a Ghibli employee, which she posted to her Twitter account on July 9.\nShe wanted to know why the Chihiro's parents turned into pigs, what was in their food, and how she managed to pass her final exam. In the letter Studio Ghibli explained that the swine transformation represented the greed that took place during Japan's bubble economy of the 80s.\nThe letter explained that once someone transforms into a pig, it's irreversible, and Miyazaki used the metaphor to describe the real world and how greed changes people. \"This doesn’t just apply to the fantasy world,\" it read.\nThe letter went on to say that none of the pigs in the pen were Chihiro's parents, which she knew because \"as a 10-year-old girl, could understand the difference because she had overcome difficulties and had managed to acquire the 'energy to live' — which is something everyone can do naturally,\" the letter stated according to a translation by RocketNews24.\nAlbeit being a bit vague, the meaning behind Chihiro's parents transformation deepens the theme on greed and sheds light on a part of Japanese history that most Spirited Away fans don't know much about. Japan's market crash of 1991 threw the country into a financial crisis so severe it's remembered today as the \"lost decades\" and Miyazaki used Chihiro's parents as a reminder that greed leads to devastating consequences. The metaphor also serves as a reminder of the richness behind Ghibli films.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " She wanted to know why the Chihiro's parents turned into pigs, what was in their food, and how she managed to pass her final exam.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Declawing Your Cat Could Become Illegal If You Live In This State\n\nArticle: Depending on who you ask, cat declawing is either feline torture or a necessary evil. The veterinary procedure has been offered for many years, but that could cease to be the case, at least in New York, if legislation to ban the practice goes though.\nFor those who don't own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it's a very serious medical operation. Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is \"cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.\"\nThe gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. \"It's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,\" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter. Kristine Brabson, site director of GoodHousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. \"It's torture to cats. Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?\"\nMost Popular\nMany cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture. To that, assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, who is sponsoring the bill, says:\n\"I've heard so many times: 'I have expensive furniture! I have nice drapes!​ If your standard is, 'I need pristine furniture,' don't get a cat.\"\nThe controversial practice is already banned in Los Angeles, Australia, Britain and many countries in Europe. This ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the U.S, the Associated Press reports.\nMeanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. \"None of us love the procedure. But when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? That's why we do it,\" says veterinarian New York City Richard Goldstein. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports the procedure, but \"only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents an above normal health risk for its owner(s).\" Still, 130 New York vets are completely supportive of the ban.\nThe bill is currently with the Senate and Assembly, but no voting date has been determined, reports the Huffington Post.\n(h/t Daily Freeman)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " New York END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why this tech company is giving 100 people free money\n\nArticle: The firm is about to give about 100 people between $1,500 and $2,000 every month to spend on whatever they please. The program, to be carried out in nearby Oakland, is meant to test a scheme called Universal Basic Income, or UBI. While it’s far from mainstream acceptance, UBI is viewed by some as a means to provide workers with economic stability as an increasing amount of the world’s labor is automated.\n\"I think we are moving towards a world with less job security,\" says Matthew Krisiloff, who is managing Y Combinator’s UBI study. \"There’s political consensus around it, and there’s relative simplicity in the sense that it’s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want.\"\nHere’s what you should know about UBI:\nWhat is Universal Basic Income?\nIn its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year.\nIn reality, it gets a little more complicated. Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money — minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions.\nWhy is it popular?\nThe basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . Some on the political left have supported UBI a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people’s quality of life, while some on the right have seen it as a way to make the existing welfare state more efficient while promoting individual choice and reducing \"welfare traps.\"\nDespite sporadic support on both sides of the aisle, UBI has historically remained on the policy fringes. Many worry that a basic income could reduce the incentive to work, slowing the economy. Another concern is whether providing a basic income is the best way to spend public funds that could be specifically targeted to certain groups in need, the model most welfare programs currently follow.\nHowever, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent Oxford University study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%).\nIs anyone getting paid yet?\nNo nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. Sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country’s existing social services, Britain’s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, Finland may implement a version of UBI next year, and a city in the Netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment .\nY Combinator’s Krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. \"I think part of the reason it’s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs,\" he says. \"People are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Y Combinator\nto test a scheme called Universal Basic Income END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: And the best country for women is...\n\nArticle: In a year that has brought us national conversations about working women, leaning in and whether or not the patriarchy is in fact \"dead,\" you might expect that all this talk signaled a real improvement for gender equality in the United States.\nAccording to the 2013 Global Gender Gap report released on Oct. 24 by the World Economic Forum, that, unfortunately, is not the case. In fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the U.S.\nThe Global Gender Gap Report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas:\n1. Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs.\n2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education.\n3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years.\n4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates.\nEach country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings. According to the report's authors, the index scores represent the \"percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men.\"\nThis year the United States ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the U.S. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373. Unfortunately, our ranking and score have both decreased since 2011. That year, the U.S. was ranked 17th, just behind the United Kingdom and just ahead of Canada, with a score of .7412.\nWhere the U.S. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress.\nAnd of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life. For example, it is illegal in both Nicaragua and the Philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy.\nAs always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the U.S. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done.\nHere are 22 countries that are more gender equal than the United States:\n1.

Given the thousands of images of Mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual,' he told MailOnline.\n'Usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light.' \nThe strange bottle shape is not the first oddity to be spotted on Mars.\nIn December last year, Nasa's Curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planet's surface.\nIt is the second 'spoon' to be found on Mars in recent years, with alien hunters claiming it could be proof of developed life on the planet.\nOther objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years. \nThe Curiosity video was uploaded to YouTube by UFO Hunter account 'secure team' with the description: 'There is a giant spoon on Mars! This thing is amazing! Probably left over from a lost civilisation.'\nAnd some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: 'Wow, it couldn't possibly be natural, could it?'\nHowever, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion.\nOne user commented: 'We see what we want to see.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Why I Won't Buy One Extra Box Of Kleenex For My Kid's School Supplies\n\nArticle: So we started doing the school supply shopping this week. A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive \"just this size\" binder. Now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it.\nI put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here).\nYes, I’m frustrated.\nAnd let’s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school?\nWell, I’ll tell you who.\nThis mom.\nI’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven’t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee?\nWe should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body.\nIf you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how.\nYes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo.\nYou think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project.\nMore is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for.\nSo, let’s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens?\nSupplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let’s see.\nDoes your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it?\nI’m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers.\nUmm, let’s back up a minute. Aren’t they the ones doing us the favor?\nI mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then.\nI’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " can afford more than that END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: This is why the media can’t stop writing about Mad Men\n\nArticle: One of the most consistent criticisms of Mad Men from those who aren't Mad Men fans is that — sniffs derisively — it's only beloved by the coastal media elite, because it's about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising.\nThat strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.)\nTo some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run.\nStill, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five.\n1) Readers wanted to read about it\nIn my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up.\nThe Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle\nThis has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content — far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle.\nYes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing.\n2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left\nWhen Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited.\nMad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general\nThus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters.\nBut Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come — and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them.\n3) There just wasn't as much good TV on\nWhen Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day.\nBut, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options.\nMad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do\nContrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday — but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do.\n4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done\nThough it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller.\n5) Never underestimate passion\nAs my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show.\nEarly on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice\nThe media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it.\nI agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire.\nBut the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1) Readers wanted to read about it\n2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left\n3) There just wasn't as much good TV on\n4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done\n5) Never underestimate passion END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: PGA Just Cancelled A Huge Tournament At Trump’s Resort. Where They Moved It To Will Infuriate Him\n\nArticle: Donald Trump continues to pay the price for his racist and divisive rabble-rousing. The Professional Golf Association (PGA) has decided to not hold their PGA Tour event at Miami’s Trump Doral resort. Instead, they will be moving the prized golf tournament – which has been held in Miami since 1962- away to Mexico City. It only took the New York real estate mogul and scam university pitchman four short years to destroy the relationship and lose the deal.\nThe orange-faced one is surely red in the face with embarrassment and rage as Mexicans publicly make a loser out of the profane bigot who dreams of building border walls at Mexico’s expense. There is little doubt that the racist Republican’s presidential campaign has cost the vulgarian’s company the prestigious PGA Cadillac Championship tournament at Trump Doral Resort, home to the famed Blue Monster.\nMexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas has picked up sponsorship when no American corporation would, and the television production and financial service behemoth got the golf tournament location they wanted in return: Mexico City. As the Miami Herald reports, it’s highly unusual to be unable to replace a sponsor in America’s televised professional sports leagues:\nLosing a title sponsor, whether of a sporting venue or event these days, defines common. Being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. Even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the PGA signed lucrative sponsor agreements. Now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which Trump declares he wants to build a wall.\nThe PGA needs a clean break from the sport’s less than glorious past track record for racial relations after an era when Afro-American-Asian legend Tiger Woods was by far the top draw for the sport. Golf’s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America’s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member’s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses. So it only makes sense that they’re following NBC’s lead in firing the shameless race-baiter from hosting one of golf’s top events now that he’s hurting the sport’s cash flow with his radioactive remarks.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee’s golf resort business is going to be awfully lonely once six more months of his endlessly crass remarks of intolerance and hatred get plastered across the internet. Trump’s open bigotry caused Cadillac to pull out as the title sponsor, and nobody else in corporate America wanted to touch Trump’s signature golf course with a ten foot pole.\nTrump handled the news poorly, blurting this out on a Fox News appearance: \"They’re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. But they’re moving it to Mexico City. And I’m saying, you know, what’s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what’s going on with our country.\"\nDonald Trump need only look in the mirror to see what’s sad and wrong, because what’s going on is Trump losing one of his golf crown jewels to Mexico due to his of stereotyping, hatred and bigotry.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mexico City END"}

He turned me on to white chocolate . (I felt so strongly about this newfound love that I wrote why it's better than all other types of chocolate). He turned me off ketchup. Big time.\n© Getty 7 Reasons Why You Should Never Eat Ketchup Why do I now have such an aversion to the weirdly sweet, super savory condiment, which rakes in $800 milly a year in sales? Here we go:\n1. A SINGLE TABLESPOON HAS MORE SUGAR THAN A CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.\n© Provided by Delish\nSounds so hard to believe, right? I know, but when a condiment is historically sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup just to make it taste good, we have a problem. One tablespoon has a whopping 3.7 grams of sugar ... by the time you're done with that boat of fries, you've had enough sugar for a few cookies.\n2. IT OVERPOWERS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES.\n© Provided by Delish\nOne of the most prominent ingredients in ketchup? Sugar. It's so cloyingly sweet that anything it gets near tastes like it-even when you wipe it off with a paper towel (trust me, I've tried).\n3. THAT GLOPPY TEXTURE IS FOUL.\nAt least other condiments have signature textures: mayo is nice and creamy. Mustard is silky (kinda). But ketchup? It's gloppy as it messily squirts out of that squeeze bottle ... unless you didn't do a proper shake and you end up with a watery first squirt, which is the WORST.\n4. THE SMELL.\n© Provided by Delish\nI don't have to be too close to ketchup to know when it's around. It has that stinky tomato smell ... rancid even. And it lingers ... FOREVER. Hours.\n5. I CAN NEVER ESCAPE IT.\nAs a ketchup hater, you can imagine the disappointment and utter grotesque when you sit down at a restaurant, whether it's a dive diner or upscale bistro, and have to share your meal with a bottle of the red stuff. Or when you order fries, they arrive with ketchup, and you have to spend the next five minutes tracking down your waitress just to get the condiment you really want with fries ... mayo! Do you know how many delicious French fries I've had to enjoy with my eyes closed? So that I don't have to bite into them with a vat of liquid red staring back at me? Even worse, when the ketchup and fries arrive together, with a few of the fries touching the villain.\n6. Y'ALL ARE TOO OBSESSED WITH IT.\nI wish America's sweetheart could be something more interesting than ketchup, but alas, the numbers speak. While mayo still ranks as the most popular condiment in America, ketchup is a close second. And that's because there isn't anything we're not dousing it on. Eggs are one that hurt my heart, and don't even get me started on omelets. But beyond that, hash browns, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets all disappoint me in their own way.\n7. IT DOESN'T BELONG ON A DAMN HOT DOG.\nNope, I'm not a Chicago native, but I do still think this is a sin. Mustard (maybe sauerkraut, too) on dogs only, never ketchup.\nNow Watch How to Make Homemade Ketchup:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1.

Amazing!\n\nArticle: You've probably heard at least one story about a crazy uncle leaving some pretty amazing, unexpected items to a relative, but this one has to beat them all.\nIn 2009, the eccentric and brilliant uncle of a brother and sister in Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom passed away, leaving them the deed to a dusty old garage.\nApparently, the late doctor had been a hoarder, so the siblings assumed they were just tasked with cleaning up a huge mess, but when they opened up the garage door, they were shocked at what they found.\nWikimedia\nDr. Harold Carr was a life-long eccentric and became a bit of recluse in his later years, so, while his family knew he kept cars, they had no idea what kind of vehicles he'd been collecting over the years.\nHis nephew told The Mirror that. \"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure, and certainly no one knew what it was worth.\"\nThe 1937 Bugatti Type 57S was found in the garage, amid piles of medical machinery, 1,500 beer steins, thousands of receipts and even a World War II spy drone.\nAnd, it was sold at auction for more than £3 million, or just over 4.3 million USD. Carr had purchased the vehicle over a half-century earlier at a cost of £895 - the equivalent of £15,500 today, or around $22,200.\nPaul Cooper via MailOnline\nIt is highly coveted by collectors as only 17 were ever made and at least four of those are thought to belong to the Musee Nationale de L'Automobile in Mulhouse, France.\nThe nephew who wished to remain anonymous also told Mail Online, \"We knew he had some cars, but we had no idea what they were.\n\"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure. It's worth so much because he hasn't used it for 50 years. It was one of the original supercars.\n\"When it was built it could reach 130mph at a time when other cars could only do 50mph. Of course we are delighted and we're going to make sure the money is shared out among the family. It's a wonderful thing to leave.\"\nHe also described his uncle, explaining that he was \"a very eccentric old gent,\" adding, \"I suppose you could call him a mad doctor. People who saw him in the street thought he was a tramp. He would wear two pairs of trousers at the same time.\"\nBonhams via MailOnline\nIn his later years, the doctor was said to have suffered from a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarded everything in the house he refused to leave. Files were piled six feet high at his home, and they even included receipts for pencils he purchased in the 1950s.\n\"Since he died, it has taken me 18 months to get where I am today,\" the nephew said.

From virtual reality to the latest installments of \"Gears of War\" and \"Battlefield,\" the newest hardware and software will be hyped by nearly 300 exhibitors at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the gaming industry's annual trade show kicking off Sunday, June 12, 2016. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File) E3 is at a crossroads.\nWhile the allure of the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo remains blockbuster console and PC games, virtual reality and mobile gaming will have a bigger presence at this year's game industry gathering. It'll kick off Sunday with briefings from Electronic Arts and Bethesda Softworks and continue through Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention Center.\n\"There are 2,000 products that are going to be shown to consumers and 130 announcements that are going to be made next week about experiences and games that no one has seen before,\" said Michael Gallagher, president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association, which organizes E3. \"There's tremendous momentum going into E3.\"\nThe festivities will spill out onto nearby streets and venues in downtown Los Angeles with companies such as Electronic Arts, Microsoft and Sony hosting fan-centric events. The organizers of E3 are joining them for the first time with their own public event, E3 Live . Gallagher expects 20,000 fans to show up for game demonstrations and other revelry.\nHere's a look at other E3 prospects:\n___\nSECOND WIND\nAs has become familiar practice at E3, a litany of sequels and prequels will be on hand at the convention, including several sophomore outings. They include the stealth adventure \"Dishonored 2,\" mech-heavy shooter \"Titanfall 2,\" superhero mash-up \"Injustice 2,\" hacker tale \"Watch Dogs 2\" and sci-fi strategy game \"Halo Wars 2.\" There will likely be many more franchise follow-ups unveiled at publishers' splashy press conferences Sunday and Monday.\n___\nNEW REALITY\nFollowing the rocky launches of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive virtual reality systems earlier this year, the immersive medium will be on the mind—and noggins—of many of the 50,000 attendees expected at E3. Gallagher said the number of VR exhibitors has doubled since last year's expo. Sony is likely to dedicate lots of energy on hyping PlayStation VR , which works in tandem with the PlayStation 4 console and is scheduled to debut this fall.\n___\nFRESH FACES\nIn this June 15, 2015 file photo, Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division and Microsoft Studios, opens the Xbox E3 2015 briefing ahead of the Electronic Entertainment Expo at the University of Southern California's Galen Center in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\nThere are several titles at E3 starring unlikely protagonists, such as scrappy survivor Joule of \"ReCore\" and introspective android Kara of \"Detroit: Become Human.\" A few sequels are adding new heroes to the fray. The young heir Emily Kaldwin is a grown-up assassin in \"Dishonored 2,\" and \"Watch Dogs 2\" will introduce an Oakland-born hacker named Marcus Holloway. \"Gears of War 4\" is centered on the son of the series' hulking star Marcus Fenix.\n___\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\nDespite the prevalence of sequels, many publishers are touting a change of scenery at E3. \"Watch Dogs 2\" is swapping Chicago for San Francisco. \"Battlefield 1\" will ditch the military shooter series' modern-day conflicts for an epic World War I setting. The true-crime romp \"Mafia III\" is moving to New Orleans in the 1960s, while the tactical shooter \"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands\" will take on corruption in an open-world rendition of Bolivia.\n___\nGENERATION X\nThere could be a few new pieces of hardware dramatically unveiled at E3 press conferences and on the show floor—but probably not. Nintendo is creating a new system codenamed NX, and Sony is working on an upgraded PlayStation 4 featuring 4K resolution, but both companies have maintained that they won't show them off at E3. Meanwhile, Microsoft may be developing its own updated version of the Xbox One that could make an E3 debut.\nExplore further: As game makers try new tactics, a turning point for E3\nMore information: www.e3expo.com\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " SECOND WIND\nNEW REALITY\nFRESH FACES\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\nGENERATION X END"}

I was missing out on​ family vacations and life's precious events. ​My overall health wasn't good either: I was diagnosed with acid reflux, diabetes and high blood pressure. I knew I needed to make a change but did I? No.\nI experimented with programs such as Weight Watchers and Medifast, the cabbage soup diet and Atkins. Within six months to a year of starting my diet, my weight would creep back up to my heaviest.\nShopping for clothes was pure hell for me. I ate myself up to a size 5XL and 30-32 blouses, 28-32 pants and 50 bra. I didn't have a lap; I couldn't hold my beautiful grandkids.\nBreaking Point: Three things: In July 2013, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Dallas and the seat belt barely fit around me. I was so embarrassed and wanted to cry. We decided to stay an extra day to tour the new Dallas stadium, and I couldn't walk the tour with my husband.\nI was so sick and tired of all the blood pressure, diabetes and acid reflux medicine. I had had enough.\nI went to dinner to celebrate July birthdays in my family. We all gathered to take pictures. Later that evening as I sat on the couch looking at the picture, I noticed that my husband could barely put his arm around me. I looked at that woman in the picture and asked, \"Who are you?\" I didn't know the woman looking back at me.\nHow I Lost It: The initial start was to remove sugar from my diet, stop late-night eating and start using the gym membership that I had been paying for for two years. I knew I had to do something different this time. I had to find a way to make it work longterm. I knew ​giving up too much and feeling deprived wasn't going to work this time.\nI looked at every diet plan I'd ever been on and came up with a lifestyle plan that would that fit my daily routine and give me long-term results. Because at the end of every diet, you've got to get back to real life.\nFor the first 30 days, I didn't eat any potatoes, pasta, white rice, flour, soda or sugar, and I drank no less than a gallon of water a day. I've learned to read labels. My meals consisted of baked chicken, fish and vegetables. As much as I try to stay away from processed foods, in some cases, it's hard to avoid, so moderation is the key.\nI make my own snacks, like roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, cashews and roasted chickpeas. I lost 20 pounds in 30 days and started going to the gym. I was sore for ​three months straight, but I kept going every day. Even after losing 20 pounds, I could only walk on the treadmill at the lowest speed, but I kept going. I would be on it for an hour, take a break and get right back on. I stuck with the treadmill for the first nine months.\nNow, I love going to the gym, and my energy level is off the charts. Everybody who knows me is cheering me on. I want to do everything: Spinning, dancing, running, horseback riding, traveling the world. Now, I can walk on the treadmill on its highest level for 45 to 50 minutes. For someone who could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, I feel like I got my life back!\nI'm no longer on any of the medications. One year later, my husband said, \"I bet you can run that Dallas stadium now!\"\nAfter Weight: 169 pounds\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " remove sugar from my diet, stop late-night eating and start using the gym membership END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Something Crazy is Happening in Switzerland, and its a Bad Sign for the World Economy\n\nArticle: Harold Cunningham/Getty Images\nInvesting in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it.\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.\nThese days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt—or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value—is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it’s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two.\nThe most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you!\nWhy are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort—you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country.\nAll of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time.

What’s more, Costco now accepts any Visa card, so you don’t need to use the one the retailer sent as a replacement for the old AmEx card.\nAnd there may be times when you probably should use a non-Costco Visa card for your Costco purchases. For instance, the Chase Freedom Visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ’s, and Sam’s Club. The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it’s been extended to the entire year\nSo, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31). After customers hit the cap, the bonus goes back to only 1%. Note that with the Chase Freedom card, the cash back is plain old cash back and does not have to be redeemed at Costco.\nFinance\nCostco\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Costco AmEx cards should switch over to the new Costco Visa Anywhere card END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here’s how much every country would have to pay to stop climate change\n\nArticle: What would it cost to avoid a climate disaster that would affect poor countries the most?\nFor the United States, the bill comes to $634 billion owed to developing nations. The U.S. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement for Debt and Development.\nWorldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check.\nThe environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. That even includes nations such as China, now the world’s largest carbon emitter.\nHow did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country’s \"fair share\" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population.\nThat means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid.\n\"We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people,\" Lidy Nacpil, director at Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development, said in a statement. \"It’s not just a question of being fair. It’s about being realistic. To be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. These deep cuts have to happen. That’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.\"\nThe tool’s calculations are based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2025.\nSivan Kartha, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, said that IPCC’s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world’s climate.\n\"Based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world. It may be hard to do, but it’s dramatically easier than surviving 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming,\" Kartha said.\nKartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in U.N. climate talks of what each country should do.\nBut how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered?\nAlex Rafalowicz, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said the creation of a transparent U.N. Green Climate Fund is paramount to the plan.\n\"The organizing of democratic, accessible, and people-first financing systems is a core part of many organizations’ demands,\" Rafalowicz wrote in an email. \"That’s why they are focused on making sure the U.N.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: What Will Humans Look Like 100,000 Years From Now?\n\nArticle: How will humans look 10,000-100,000 years from now? originally appeared on Quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.\nAnswer by Matan Shelomi, Organismic and Evolutionary Biologist, on Quora:\nAll life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesn't stop. As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes.\nThousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.\nAnother famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too.\nAnother example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.\nOur mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet.\nDarwin's theory of natural selection evolves.\nSo what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? Even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. Ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes. Who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence?\nThis question originally appeared on Quora. Ask a question, get a great answer.

It said that the foetus was detected with anencephaly, a serious defect where parts of the skull are not adequately developed.\nOn the basis board's suggestion, the bench allowed the lady to undergo an abortion and directed that the termination would be done under the supervision of the board.

The law permits a woman to terminate her pregnancy till 20 weeks if two registered practitioners express the unanimous opinion that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or the foetus has severe abnormalities.\nThis is the third incident in recent years when the apex court has allowed women to abort beyond the period prescribed by law. In July last year, the court had allowed a rape survivor's distress plea to abort her 24-week pregnancy citing serious abnormalities with the foetus.\nThe court had allowed her to abort on the basis of a medical report from KEM hospital which said that foetus had serious abnormalities with slim chances of surviving the full term.\nOriginally Published in the Times Of India\njust in\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " foetus was detected with anencephaly, a serious defect where parts of the skull are not adequately developed END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Can \"wax\" help save endangered mammals?\n\nArticle: Wax inside a whale’s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal’s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life, researchers have found.\nThe team, led by Sascha Usenko, a environmental scientist at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, extracted an earplug from a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) killed in a collision with a ship off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, in 2007 and found it had come into contact with several organic pollutants and contained high levels of the stress hormone cortisol as it reached sexual maturity.\n\"It’s difficult to recover time-specific information on chemical exposure for almost any animal,\" says Stephen Trumble, a biologist also at Baylor and a co-author of the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. That is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world’s largest inhabitant.\nDecimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000–12,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. Scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. But analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted.\nThe whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study.\nWhale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. But it also records time — similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. In baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death.\nChemical signatures\nUsenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. During his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. Exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year — and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact — suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing.\nMaternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. Once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. \"Some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years,\" says Usenko. Other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. Mercury — which can cause brain damage — spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years.\nOver the whale’s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. The peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. But it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise.\nThe research is \"exciting\", says Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine biologist at Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington, but \"the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study.\"\nThe male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study. (Michelle Berman-Kowalewskic, Ph.D., Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Santa Barbara, Calif.)\nUsenko and his team are now hoping to investigate that question by analysing some of the 1,000 or more whale specimens in museums worldwide. \"If we can look at individuals that lived in an environment without some of the stresses we see now, then we could tease out the causes of the cortisol increase,\" he says.\nThis story originally appeared in Nature News.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Wax inside a whale’s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal’s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: Fertility expert reveals the pregnancy etiquette EVERYONE should follow\n\nArticle: When someone tells you they are pregnant, it might feel natural to touch their bump or comment on how big they are getting. \nBut although these comments are not intentionally rude, insensitive, or inappropriate, they can easily come across the wrong way to a woman who is on a hormonal roller coaster.\nSo what should you be saying to your friend who is expecting? Midwife & fertility guru Zita West, who has helped thousands of women get pregnant and looked after celebrities including Kate Winslet and Sophie Wessex during their pregnancies, shares her advice.\n1. Don't touch her bump\nInvading people's personal space is not normal etiquette for everyday life. You wouldn't rub or touch someone's belly on a normal day, so why is this any different? \nIf you really want to, you can politely ask if you can touch someone's pregnant belly, but don't be offended if they say no as this is one of the most annoying and uncomfortable moments for pregnant woman. \nIf her baby is kicking and she wants you to have a feel, she'll invite you to.\n2. Don't ask if she has chosen a name\nThis might not seem like a big deal, but it can be to those who haven't thought of a name yet or those that have, but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinions. \nGone are the days when we would name our child John or Jane, in recent times there's been a general trend to more creative names, such as Wolf or Apple. \nProblems arise when she tells you what she's going to name her child, and you can't resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision. \nHearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be. It's easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born. \nI've found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time, even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first.\n3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant\nThis often happens with women I see who are also in high flying jobs. When they say they are pregnant, their friends and colleagues jaws drop open and they get things like 'But you're such a career woman' or 'I didn't think you were maternal'. \nPeople can be ambitious and be mums. It's not one or the other. Whether or not you've seen her maternal side doesn't mean she doesn't have one! \nAnd whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a 'maternal woman' doesn't mean she won't be a brilliant mother.\n4. Don't tell her she's getting bigger (and bigger)\nWhile seeing a friend's bump grow can be really exciting, don't comment on the size or shape. \nMany of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds. \nA pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there's no need to be constantly reminding her that she's huge, big, or massive. Even if she's looking a large she doesn't need to hear it.\n5. Don't tell her she's not big enough\nFollowing on from the previous comment, it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them, 'are you gaining enough weight?' \nYou may think you're paying a mama-to-be a compliment when you say, 'You're so tiny' or 'I can barely see your belly!' but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby.\n6. Don't congratulate her on social media\nIf someone tells you they're pregnant, they have chosen to tell you and not your friends, family and random followers on social media. \nThe decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you, therefore, don't instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they haven't told yet, or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready.\n7. Don't act like she's sick\nAlthough pregnancy is in a way a medical condition, pregnancy is not an illness. \nPregnant woman can still have fun, go out, exercise and more, attend meetings, head departments and in today's day and age, where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses, building extensions and becoming mothers, they last thing they want is to be treated differently. \nEvery woman is different, some may have severe symptoms, some may find pregnancy a breeze, only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take. \nThat said, pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube.\n8. Don't tell her labour horror stories\nWhenever anyone's having a baby, others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour. \nBut telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency c-section and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful. \nLabour is a process and the great news is that in today's world, with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control, most women get through it, and usually, once the baby arrives, memories of labour fade away. \nIt is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories, so don't share them.\n9. Do tell her she's going to be just fine\nPregnancy can be a scary time for women. Their lives are about to change and many fear how they will think/feel/cope 'on the other side'. \nThe bottom line is that all women try their best and most women, even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive. \nIt might take some longer than others to take to motherhood, but that is understandable as there's a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby, and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle, whether that's other children, elderly relatives, high flying careers, evening courses, husbands and everything else. \nIf you throw in fear of post-partum depression and then the very real experience of having post-partum depression, it's no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead. \nBut I've met thousands of mothers over the years and you know, they've nearly all been absolutely fine, grown into their new role admirably, coped well and become wonderful parents. This is what she needs to hear. \n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 1. Don't touch her bump\n2. Don't ask if she has chosen a name\n3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant\n4.

Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price. More adjustments can probably be expected as gambling websites close or alter how they operate, but my belief is that these items will retain most of their value as long as CS:GO remains one of the most-played and most-spectated games in the world.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " fell an average of 13.7% END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: In 2002, The Dillinger Escape Plan singer took a dump onstage at Reading Festival; in 2016, he did THIS...\n\nArticle: The Dillinger Escape Plan have returned to Reading Festival for the first time after vocalist Greg Puciato took a dump onstage and hurled his excrement into the crowd during the band's 2002 performance at the event, all because of Puddle of Mudd.\nThis time around, the singer emphasized his civilized side by singing the set's opening number \"Prancer\" sitting on a couch, reading newspaper and sipping tea.\nAs widely reported, the Dillinger boys are breaking up after the release and touring cycle of their upcoming album \"Dissociation,\" due out on October 7.\nPuciato told Metal Hammer about the band's decision: \"'Extended hiatus' would leave people to believe that we think that we're coming back. We're breaking up, we're not going on an 'extended hiatus.'\n\"This is a really weird thing to say but we really do still love what we do. We don't love it any less.\n\"We don't love making records any less. We don't love being onstage any less. And that's the hard part - you're making a choice to stop doing something you love which sounds insane to people.\n\"But really what it's about is realizing that if you're a painter you don't just paint until you run out of paint. You don't just paint until your arm falls off. You make a decision at some time that you made a final brushstroke.\n\"Or when you make a movie you don't just film until you run out of film or hard drive space, you make a decision artistically to say, 'Even if I'm having the best time ever, this is the end.'\n\"So in the last few years we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band, you know particularly Ben and I where we realized that in our lives psychologically that we were reaching sort of a resolve.\n\"And that we had used our relationship with one another and our artistic outlet together in Dillinger Escape Plan to kind of work through a lot of things as people and as a couple of people. We started to reach this resolve - a thematic resolve - and it started to show itself in our music and our lyrics.\n\"And I think we both just started to realize like, 'Hey, if we're ever going to draw a line and say this is over, this seems like a good time.' And we started talking about it and the fear aspect of it in a way, cause right away there was this gut feeling of, 'Oh shit, my safety net is being taken away.'\n\"Once you got over that fear I think we started to realize that this feels like a very empowering move to say hey, now you can look at the Dillinger Escape Plan as a body, an artistic body, not just on an album-to-album basis, but you can look at the whole band artistically and say this is what this was. And it had a beginning and it had an end and they did close the circle and it is this thing that you can look at as a whole.\n\"You know I don't like TV shows where they just go on and on and on until the ratings die. I like a movie where someone says hey this has an end and I made it and at the end I don't want to do another one. I don't want to see 'Pirates of the Caribbean 7' you know?\n\"And I feel like once we started to wrap our brains around that we started to feel really comfortable about it. It feels correct, that's all I can say about it.\"\nBack to the Reading 2016 performance, you can check out the footage below.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " singing the set's opening number \"Prancer\" sitting on a couch, reading newspaper and sipping tea.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Can Linux ever beat Windows at PC gaming?\n\nArticle: Can Linux ever beat Windows at PC gaming?\nWindows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?\nA writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.\nGame Carey reports for TechRadar:\nEvidently, Windows isn’t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there’s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve’s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. There’s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar\nDistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3’s new features\nJesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.\nJesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:\nFreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch\nLinus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6\nLinus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild.\nSimon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register:\nNew this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820. IBM’s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: You Can Be Mentally Stronger If You Do This Small Act Every Day\n\nArticle: As humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them. That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals.\nAs psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions:\nThe impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety.\nBy celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal.\nThe Dangers of Dreaming Big\nWe are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal.\nFor every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear:\nOur sense of self-worth can be worsened\nWe risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress\nWe are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved\nThe increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health\nOnce we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health.\nHere is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins:\nStep 1: Start small\nFirst of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem.\nStep 2: Reflect often\nEvery once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself — with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions.\nStep 3: Reward yourself\nFrom early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends.\nStep 4: Enjoy the process\nMaybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing. By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don’t achieve the ultimate goal.\nENDORSED BY Ricky Tang Editor\nLove this article?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " counting each small win we make END"}

The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy.\nPerhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time.\n\"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers.\nAs a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan.\nThe shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down.\nOn 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan.\nTaiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short.\nBut people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure.\nYou might also be interested in\nIn an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down.\n\"I went home and cried all night,\" she said.\nBut it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\".\nShelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters.\n\"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers.\n\"But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough.\"\nHigh kill rate\nTaiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce.\nIn reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions.\nBut the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed.\nIn 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness.\nIn the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down.\n\"We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the 'humane room'.\n\"When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad.\"\nNo psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan.\nThe Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter.\nBut a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide.\n\"She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,\" said Ms Lai.\nIn the letter, Ms Chien wrote: \"I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.\"\nThe irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out.\nNewspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing.\nSome accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility.\nMany believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law.\nThe chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately.\nAnd even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered.\n\"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\"\nSome Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell.\nShort-term measures\nMs Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force.\nFrom 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (£100).\nThe authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy.\nThe government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures.\nActivists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays.\nPerhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals.

For a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called Sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp.\nWell, this new hero isn’t Sombra. Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don’t be disheartened, as you’re in for a lot of fun. This new hero’s name? Ana.

Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper.\nCheck out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect.\nMuch like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it’s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah’s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team.\nAna taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn’t want the same life for Pharah as she’d had, although I’d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless.\nAna’s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. Looking to the future, it’ll be interesting to see how Ana affects the game’s balance, and just who, or what, else Blizzard has up their sleeve.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: How to Fall Asleep in Under a Minute\n\nArticle: Tech savvy . Culturally aware . Underemployed . Spiritual but not religious .\nThese are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the \"Milliennial Generation,\" which is also sometimes referred to as Generation Y. Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless .\nThe correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia.\nAccording to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures.\nWhy does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body’s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate.\nFight or Flight or... Sleep?\nThese are, in short, all individual components of the body’s intrinsic and universally acknowledged \"fight-or-flight\" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night.\nBest-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes:\n\"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\"\nBecause the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath.\nThat being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies.\nHow to Do The \"4-7-8′′ Exercise\nDr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere.\nHere is how you do the exercise:\nPlace the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.\nIn a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.\nAlina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding.\nWhen Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly.\nThe 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the \"performance killer\" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?\n\nArticle: Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?\nAn investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players.\nBy Kate Wheeling\nThen-Baylor head coach Art Briles looks on from the sidelines. (Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)\nLast week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports:\nMr. Starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them.\nThe relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they’re the ones accused of committing the crime?\nOne factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression.\nThe recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"\nCollege athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports — football and hockey, for example — violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"\nAnd the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to \"use force\" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions.\nWhile members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of \"power and performance sports\" — football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball — commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket.\nWithout better data, it’s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes.\nWe can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. Still, the recent investigation at Baylor found that the university’s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " While members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Is It Safe to Drink Blood?\n\nArticle: With such a high interest in vampires these days — they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves — many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires.\nTurns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: In 2011, a 19-year-old Texas man named Lyle Bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault.\nBut is it safe to drink blood?\nIn very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases]\nThe strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires]\nBecause blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.\nEven so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC.\nUnlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\"\nYou, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.\nIf you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.\nEditor's Note: This article was first published on Sept. 2, 2011.\nBenjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of six books including Scientific Paranormal Investigation: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries.

We’re good at something! Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners.\nThe study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships.\nThis is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense. Whether we like it or not, money affects our everyday lives, from where we live to what we eat. It’s hard to keep the romance alive if you’re feeling stressed out about money and you’re afraid of talking to your partner about something that affects the both of you so closely.\nThe fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer. Though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations.\nThe survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters. Most of the couples classified themselves as \"married\" or \"committed.\" Millennials were classified as participants who were 18-34 years old.\nAmong this group, couples were found to be much happier on average than the other demographics, with 49% of the millennial couples saying that they’re \"extremely happy\" with their \"soulmate.\" Awww!\nOf course, this survey isn’t a blanket statement about any particular generation or couple, and every individual and couple has their own challenges to face, but it is still awesome to see something positive being said about the millennial age group.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: \"I’d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in.\"\n\nArticle: The first hint of trouble came just a week after I had knee replacement surgery. I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press.\nThat seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime — rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac.\nMonths later, I still hadn’t picked up an oar. Instead, I’d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I’d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task.\nThe culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body’s joints.\nNever heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.\nFortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.\nWhy and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.\nWith the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America’s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.\nBasically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body — sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs — some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar — keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow’s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.\nSuch an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O’Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.\n\"It’s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said.\nMany people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.\nPhil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn’t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.\n\"I thought I’d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, ‘What’s wrong with Papa?’ \"\nUnable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation’s top diagnostic clinics, \"they basically said, ‘You’re an old guy.’ \" Ringo said. \" ‘ Just get used to it.’ \" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.\nActually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.\n\"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.\nSo the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.\nAlong the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.\nEventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath’s doctor, who started her on prednisone.\n\"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they’re just aging and can’t do everything they used to — when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.\nMost doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.\nWhen I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age — 73 — my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.\nMy rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free — a sign of a cure — sometime in 2017.\n\"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\"\nFor a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno’s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\"\nMost patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.\nAlthough diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.\nAny one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.\nMuch of today’s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.\nBiologics — drugs made from living organisms — hold promise because some can \"inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,\" the Arthritis Foundation’s O’Koon Moss said. \"It’s like interrupting a chain reaction.\"\n\"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said.\nUntil other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.\nAs I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you’ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.\nThe rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " polymyalgia rheumatica END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: How the Chicago Cubs won Game 7\n\nArticle: But 2016 was the 108th year after their last title, and a baseball is sewn together with 108 stitches. This had to be the year.\nIt was.\nOn Wednesday night the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-7, in a Game 7 for the ages. With that victory — yes, the following words are really true — the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.\nBut it just couldn’t come easy, couldn’t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning.\nThen the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed.\nIt is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one.\nUpon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days.\nIn Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland’s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June.\nFor the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever.\nTheo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs’ top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history’s long reach.\nPrior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both.\nHere’s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7:\nTop of 1st: Fowler Crushes One\nCorey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland’s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series.\nAfter Fowler’s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single.\nKris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning.\nKluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for.\nDavid Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans.\nBottom of 1st: Indians Can’t Match Cubs’ Start\nThe Indians were not able to match the Cubs’ strong start to the game.\nLeadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning.\nVictor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs.\nDavid Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \"My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\" he said. Too much info?\nTop of 2nd: Kluber Settles In\nKluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop.\nDavid Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it’s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even.\nBottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself\nThe Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it.\nJose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first.\nLonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis’s speed.\nDavid Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out.\nThe Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather.\nTop of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning\nJavier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning.\nVictor Mather: Maybe you aren’t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron.\nDavid Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P.

For the cover story of the magazine, Oprah Winfrey even jetted off to one of the nation's most dramatic natural wonders: the Grand Canyon. And yet, she confesses in the magazine's pages that she's actually a homebody. It makes sense: Earlier this year Winfrey bought a $28.9 million equestrian ranch in California. On the 42-acre property is a 4,800-square-foot house with four fireplaces and a pool, plus plenty of horse stables and riding rings. This isn't Winfrey's only cushy crash pad: She also owns a $14 million mountaintop ski chalet in Telluride, Colorado with its own wine mine, as well as over-the-top properties in Santa Barbara, California, and Maui. \nMadonna walks along a street in Havana.

For her birthday this August, Madonna jetted off to Cuba with her children and a group of close friends. They danced on tables at a bar in Havana, toured the city in vintage 1950s cars and stayed at the Hotel Saratoga. In the past year alone, the Queen of Pop has had a number of glamorous trips. She has also been spotted in the southern Italy town of Puglia for a friend's wedding; in the African countries of Kenya and Malawi with her adopted children; and in London, just to name a few. And that's not all: Madonna also owns a horse farm in the tony Hamptons enclave of Bridgehampton, a triple-wide townhouse in Manhattan and she reportedly bought a $20 million penthouse in Tel Aviv.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Game of Thrones: Did you catch this subtle change during the finale?\n\nArticle:  \nIt didn’t take long for last night’s Game of Thrones finale to win fans over. As the opening credits rolled, a subtle but important change was made to the animation, causing fans of the show to shout with glee. Did you miss it? Observant viewers spotted it right away.\nPrior to Sunday’s finale, the castle at Winterfell was adorned with the gruesome Bolton sigil, which is a picture of a flayed man hanging upside-down. It’s a nasty image but one that’s meant to strike fear into the Bolton’s enemies; the house was infamous for the centuries-old practice, and because Ramsay had taken over Winterfell, the sigil was prominently displayed in the show’s opening credits.\nBut as of Sunday’s finale, the Stark sigil was back in its rightful place. It was a subtle change but a big moment for the show because of how important \"Battle of the Bastards\" was. Fans were understandably pumped about the change; all seems right in the Game of Thrones universe—at least for now.\nAlso notable is that it reflects Jon’s newfound status as King in the North. Because Jon is thought to be a bastard, custom dictates the colors of the sigil be reversed. Instead of a gray direwolf on a white background, it’s now a white wolf on a gray background. Not an insignificant change, especially because Jon’s new nickname is White Wolf.\nWith winter finally here, can Jon ensure the survival of Winterfell? Unfortunately, it’ll be many months before the show returns for season 7, so we have a long way until we find out.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the Stark sigil was back in its rightful place END"}

Last week my colleague Karsten Strauss covered the most stressful jobs, and this week I'm writing about the least stressful.\nCareerCast evaluated 200 professions and rated them on 11 measures of stress, such as the amount of travel required, the growth potential of the industry and job, and the physical demands of the role. The report isn't a survey CareerCast relies largely on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to score every position on each metric, and then rolls that up into an overall stress score. More methodology details are available here.\nTo see the 10 least stressful jobs and their median salaries, view the gallery below.\nAlthough these jobs are rated as low-stress based on CareerCast's approach, by no means are they easy or unimportant. Some, such as audiologist and tenured professor, require a Ph.D. Others, like medical and pharmacy technicians, provide critical support in the process of saving lives.\nCareerCast's stress ratings are averages, and exceptions always arise. For instance, having a difficult manager or extremely demanding clients can make any job unpleasant. Also, much stress is self-induced and best managed by means other than switching jobs, like limiting the number of tasks you take on. But we wanted to publish this list because we think it's informative and thought-provoking. Two years ago, my colleague Susan Adams published many interesting reader responses to an earlier version of this annual list.\nDiagnostic medical sonographer ranked first on CareerCast's list of the least stressful jobs. Photo credit: Shutterstock.\nDiagnostic medical sonographer was rated as the least stressful job. The position involves using medical imaging equipment like ultrasound machines. Medical sonographers assist physicians in conducting and interpreting these tests, and to become one, you'll need to take an accreditation program that lasts between one and four years. Median pay in 2015 was $63,630.\nThe second-least stressful job was compliance officer, a role with a median salary of $65,640 that requires making sure your colleagues abide by laws and regulations. A compliance officer at a bank might monitor traders to check if they're following insider trading regulations.\nOperations research analyst ranked eighth, with median income of $78,630.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: Here's How Much You're Going To Spend On The Holidays This Year\n\nArticle: It may feel like it’s too early to even talk about holiday shopping, but in reality, two out of five millennial shoppers have already started buying presents for the holiday season. Some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up.\nErin Dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. She says it’s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule.\n\"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\"\nErin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn’t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she’s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases.\n\"I start saving early so I have a little stash that I know is for others. Buying now means if something goes wrong, I can pay for it all and not feel like I have to choose between [buying] presents or fixing my car if it were to break,\" she says.\nWhile we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.\nErin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she’s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiancé, her fiancé’s parents and her two best friends.\n\"For the parents, nana and brother, my fiancé and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom’s present and I know what I’m getting for everyone,\" says Erin. \"My fiancé and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we’re getting each other an experience while we’re there, that’s the only one I’m really waiting on.\"\nMillennials aren’t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it’s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.\nParents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. (The men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they’d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they’ll spend on themselves.)\nAs for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers.\n\"Most of [my shopping] will be online,\" says Erin. \"It’s just easier that way. I can compare prices a little easier than in the stores, and I use cash back extensions on my browser which helps get some money back.\"\nWalmart and Amazon are still predicted to be in the top retail spots for 2016 holiday shopping, but millennials heavily favor Amazon. And l ike Erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing.\nOverall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year’s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015.\nIn addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals. Based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it’s not surprising that Cyber Monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device.\nWe’re not even into October yet, so there’s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. And the sooner you start, the more you’ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December. Even if you’re opposed to buying in October, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " $1,427 END"}

{"prompt": "Clickbait: The Strange Reason Nearly Every Film Ends by Saying It’s Fiction\n\nArticle: Virtually every film in modern memory ends with some variation of the same disclaimer: \"This is a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental.\" The cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. Who knew its origins were so lurid?\nFor that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio’s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin’s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him.\nHere’s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin—the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant—had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him.\nAlthough the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina. (In doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.)\nA Slate Plus Special Feature: Radio Drama Has Returned to the Spotlight—Now What? The Culture Gabfest’s producer explains why radio drama isn’t dead. Listen to this special Slate Plus bonus segment by joining – your first two weeks are free.\nSixteen years later, MGM produced Rasputin and the Empress, based on those events. Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings—stars of stage and silent film—in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was \"Prince Paul Chegodieff,\" a composite, who murders Rasputin.\nYusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin—in part because he’d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn’t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was \"really intended to represent [Yusupov].\"\nBut having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn’t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife.\nIn the film, Chegodieff’s wife is \"Princess Natasha,\" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha—by his logic, with which she agrees—unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: \"Rasputin sucks,\" \"Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,\" etc.)\nAn MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina—about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to \"the old girl\"—but MGM couldn’t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles.\nPoster via Wikimedia Commons\nIrina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her £25,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time.\nWhat proved to be MGM’s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they’d prefaced the film with this: \"This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence.\" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs.\nA justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.\nApparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything. For decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality—even when it was patently untrue. The Jake LaMotta biopic Raging Bull credits LaMotta as a consultant and cites his memoir as a source text just minutes before asserting that he is the film’s entirely fictional invention.\nComedy Central\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio’s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin’s murder.

But apart from smelling, microbiologists say there is nothing to worry about from a health perspective if you never wash your jeans.\nIs not washing your jeans safe?\nThere is no evidence that not washing jeans is hazardous to your health, according to Bernhard Redl, an associate professor in the molecular biology department at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. This generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear.\nBacteria, skin cells, and sweat are transferred to our pants from our own body but \"skin microorganisms are generally not hazardous to ourselves,\" said Rachel McQueen, a professor of human ecology at the University of Alberta in Canada. McQueen's research focuses on the development and retention of odors in textiles.\n\"There are environments where having sterile clothing is important,\" McQueen said. That would be true in a hospital, for example, where clothing can transfer infections. However, \"sanitizing your hands is going to be a more important issue here than washing your jeans,\" she said.\nA few years ago, one of McQueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them. The student-teacher team was surprised to find that the unwashed jeans carried nearly the same amount of bacteria as those same pants after they had been washed and then worn for another 13 days.\n\"What I found was just normal skin flora,\" McQueen told The National Post in 2011. \"The counts were really, really similar. The bacteria load from the swabbed areas were pretty much the same.\"\nThe freezing myth\nAlthough not washing your jeans doesn't seem to pose any health risks, the smell could become a problem. Denim-heads have suggested freezing your jeans as a way to kill bacteria and the stench, although there is no scientific proof that this method is effective.\n\"It is clear that freezing does not kill most of the bacteria,\" said Redl, \"but puts them in a dormant state.\" Bacteria stops growing in the freezer, but will become active again once you slip your pants back on and those germs are warmed up by the heat of your body.\n\"I think airing your jeans outdoors in the sunlight would be a more effective method of getting rid of odors and a lot of bacteria,\" said McQueen.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A few years ago, one of McQueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: KFC’s secret ingredient is 'the most under-appreciated spice' in the world\n\nArticle: Colonel Sanders' nephew recently revealed what he claims is the secret recipe for KFC chicken. Although KFC has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub.\nThe famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper.\n\"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s.\nFood scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe.\n\"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction.\nBut he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense.\n\"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said.\nWhite pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade.\nWhite pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets.\nThe upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting.\n\"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says.\nKFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows:\n2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. salt\n1/2 tbsp. thyme\n1/2 tbsp. basil\n1/3 tbsp. oregano\n1 tbsp. celery salt\n1 tbsp. black pepper\n1 tbsp. dried mustard\n4 tbsp. paprika\n2 tbsp. garlic salt\n1 tbsp. ground ginger\n3 tbsp. white pepper\nAs great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness.\nAnd that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " white pepper END"}
{"prompt": "Clickbait: One Guy Decided To Explore This Abandoned Building... And Instantly Regretted It.\n\nArticle: Have you ever come across an abandoned building and just get the feeling that something amazing could be inside? I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren’t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I’m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I’m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people’s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you’ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It’s never the same thing twice though. You really don’t have any idea what you’re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last.\nHe starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie.\nDan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn’t seem to get it off his mind.\nDan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step.\nHe climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building.\nTrash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren’t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight.\nThe remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used.\nFalling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It’s so old the wood is rotting and won’t support the weight it used too.\nIt became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently \"Tony\" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point.\nFinding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise.\nA tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It’s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit.\nAfter walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. This would be a turning point in the video. What happens next is something that I would never want to experience.\nDan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. When he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn’t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings.\nJust an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. The Snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. Of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further!\nWell damn! That’s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! As soon as I saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. This isn’t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore.\nAfter examining the contents of the container, Dan understandably got seriously freaked out. This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less. Well guess what? The dealer comes back!\nPretty damn intense right?! This guy is seriously super lucky. I don’t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. This building is definitely in the slums. If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it’s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway. You can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside. He really was lucky to escape with his life.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less.

{"prompt": "Clickbait: WikiLeaks' Julian Assange Reported Dead\n\nArticle: On 16 October 2016, WikiLeaks posted a series of cryptic numeric tweets, leading many onlookers to conclude that founder Julian Assange was in danger and likely dead (and thus a dead man’s switch had been activated):\npre-commitment 1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809 — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 16, 2016\npre-commitment 2: Ecuador eae5c9b064ed649ba468f0800abf8b56ae5cfe355b93b1ce90a1b92a48a9ab72 — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 16, 2016\npre-commitment 3: UK FCO f33a6de5c627e3270ed3e02f62cd0c857467a780cf6123d2172d80d02a072f74 — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 16, 2016\nThe appearance of the tweeted sequences of digits led to rampant rumors Assange had been threatened, a circumstance that activated a protocol for Assange’s safety that was reported in 2010:\nSupporters of WikiLeaks around the world are downloading a file the site calls an insurance policy. The files are encrypted with a code so strong it’s unbreakable, even by governments. If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies. \"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the U.S. government if it were released,\" said Declan McCullagh, chief political correspondent for CNET, a CBS company.\nNot long after the mysterious tweets appeared in October 2016, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous asserted that they were not indicative of harm coming to Assange — he was presumably, fine and the tweets were a form of data integrity verification:\nClarification: Wikileaks tweeted out sha256sum coded messages, not deadman keys. Assange is fine as far as we know. Carry on. — Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) October 17, 2016\nA Gizmodo article described the series of tweets and their less ominous potential purpose:\nMuch as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight. \"Pre-commitment\" in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes. The same strategy was used by Tor Project developer Andrea Shepard in a warning shot that may have helped reveal years of Jacob Applebaum’s sexual misconduct. Likewise, Edward Snowden tweeted (and quickly deleted) a similar code in August, though its meaning remains uncertain. A torrent file and accompanying SHA-512 hash was even used by someone on Reddit’s r/SilkRoad to share sensitive forum information. The tweets from Wikileaks appear to be in line with these prior examples—and surely a true \"dead man’s switch\" unleashing all the data Assange currently possesses would amount to much more than three measly leaks.\nWikiLeaks regularly tweets about Assange’s status and whereabouts, and shortly after the cryptic tweets were posted, WikiLeaks proclaimed that a \"state actor\" had cut off Assange’s Internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange had remained since seeking asylum from that country in June 2012:\nJulian Assange’s internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party. We have activated the appropriate contingency plans. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 17, 2016\nMany commenters have been connecting the alleged severing of Assange’s Internet connection with WikiLeaks’ recent release of sensitive material about Hillary Clinton’s campaign and/or claims that WikiLeaks is working with the Russian government to assist Donald Trump’s campaign, suggesting that the U.S. government is (or influenced) the \"state party\" behind the act:\nJohn Kerry has threatened the Ecuadorian President with \"grave consequences for Equador\" if Assange is not silenced @StoneColdTruth — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 17, 2016\nOne of the odder theories holds that former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, who had recently paid a visit to Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy and brought him some bags from the Pret A Manger sandwich chain, might have been involved in nefarious doings:\n@alburyj GET ASSANGE OUT OF THERE AND INTO HIDING.
